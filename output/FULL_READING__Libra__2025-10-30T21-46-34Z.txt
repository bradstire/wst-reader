Hey Libra! October’s wrapping up, and I’m seeing a vibe where you’re feeling the weight drop off—or at least shifting somehow. Something that had you bent over backwards might be loosening its grip. You’re noticing that, right? Like, things you’ve been carrying, maybe longer than you should, are suddenly less... urgent. Or maybe you’re just done pretending they are.

Ten of Wands, reversed. Oh wow. This card’s shouting one thing loud and clear: you’re letting go of a huge load. Not just deciding to drop it, but finally actually doing it. You knew this was coming, didn’t you? You’ve been dragging so much stress, responsibilities, or emotional baggage that it’s been crushing your vibe. And now, you’re done. Maybe you stopped trying to fix everything on your own, or maybe you just gave up on trying to carry all that weight alone. Either way, the energy here is about relief—but it’s not magic. It’s slow. It’s messy. It’s that moment when you realize the pile in your hands is too much and you just... set it down. Whether that’s at work, with family, or in a relationship—it’s happening.

I’m seeing there’s some frustration under this. You could have been burned out for a while, feeling like you’re the only one putting in the effort. That supporting energy underneath is showing teamwork problems, or maybe you felt unappreciated. Like you were building something with others, but they weren’t pulling their weight. That’s this energy, creeping in quietly here. You probably had to carry the plan, the vision, or the daily grind alone, and that’s what led to this snap where you just can’t do it anymore. You tried to get help and it didn’t come, or you asked for support and got radio silence. So now, you’re stepping back.

There’s also this sense of leaving behind a tough situation—mentally or physically. this energy shows up as a quiet undercurrent to this card’s energy. It suggests you’re moving away from a place that’s been draining you, maybe even a mindset that kept you stuck. Not necessarily a dramatic exit, but a slow, steady shift. You might still be dealing with the fallout of what you dropped, but you’re in transit. You’re not where you were, and you’re not quite where you want to be yet, but you’re moving.

You might have noticed you’re not as reactive anymore. You’re less likely to pick up extra shifts, say yes to every favor, or answer every call that pulls you into drama. You’re setting boundaries without a lot of fanfare. That’s huge, especially if you used to carry everyone else’s burden like it was your job. This is the energy of taking back your space. And honestly, you’ve earned it. You might be surprised at how good it feels to finally admit you can’t do it all—and then act on it.

But, and this is important, don’t rush this. Dropping the load doesn’t mean you’re fixed overnight. You might still feel the strain, the old habits pulling you back in. That’s normal. The key is you’re aware now. You’re not pretending to be fine or pushing through exhaustion. You’re choosing what to keep and what to let go. That’s work, even if it looks like a break.

Yeah. This is a pivot point. You’re shifting from overwhelmed to intentional. You’re not carrying what’s not yours anymore. This is about survival, but more than that, it’s about reclaiming your energy. You knew this already, right? You saw it coming every time you felt tired, over it, or like you just wanted to scream. Now, you’re acting on it.

Hold on. There’s more showing up here. But for now, let me sit with this energy a second. Yeah, okay.

Six of Cups. Oh wow.

Alright, so this card just popped up right after the Ten of Wands, reversed — that weight dropping off your shoulders, but not without a little resistance. The Six of Cups is pulling you back to old times, memories, maybe even people from the past. But here’s the twist: it’s not about daydreaming or getting stuck in nostalgia. No, this energy is asking you to look at what’s behind those memories and how they’re showing up now.

You might be dealing with someone who feels familiar, or a situation that repeats like a skipped record. this energy, lurking underneath, says teamwork or collaboration is off. That’s where the tension lies. Maybe you or the other person are not showing up fully, or the effort isn’t equal. You’re caught between wanting to return to something comfortable and realizing the foundation isn’t solid.

this energy under the surface adds another layer. It’s about moving on, heading toward calmer waters. But it’s not an easy ride — the transition feels heavy, even if you’re trying to escape the chaos. You haven’t fully left that old place behind. You’re navigating the space between what used to be and what could be, and that middle ground is uncomfortable. You knew this already; you just didn’t want to admit it.

Look, the past isn’t just a happy place with warm smiles. It’s also where you learned patterns, sometimes toxic ones. This card asks you: are you really ready to revisit that, or are you romanticizing it to avoid the hard work of moving forward? The reversed this energy says the collaboration isn’t working because someone’s holding back, maybe you. Maybe they are. You’re not building anything new here; you’re trying to patch up what’s already broken.

this energy is whispering, “You gotta leave something behind.” But there’s hesitation. You’re stuck in that liminal space. You’re not fully stepping into the new, nor are you completely in the old. That’s exhausting. The energy underneath is one of transition, but it’s messy.

If you’re waiting for someone from the past to change or come back different, watch what they do, not what they say. The reversed this energy is a red flag for uneven effort. You’re not the only one with history here — they have their own baggage too. You knew this before you said it out loud. Don’t lie to yourself.

There’s a choice to be made: stay comfortable in a flawed partnership or situation, or push through the discomfort of real change. The Six of Cups isn’t about forgetting the past but about learning the lesson and not repeating the same mistakes. The presence of this energy suggests you’re trying to move on, but the reversed this energy reminds us that growth doesn’t happen alone. If collaboration keeps failing, maybe the partnership is done.

You might feel pulled between the familiarity of what’s behind and the uncertainty ahead. That’s normal. But the weight of the past can’t keep hanging over you like it did with the Ten of Wands, reversed. You dropped the burden, but you haven’t dropped the history yet.

So, what’s the next move? Watch for uneven energy from others. If they don’t meet you halfway, it’s on them. You’re neither the fixer nor the caretaker here. You’re done playing that role. You’re halfway out already, even if you don’t realize it.

Mm.

The Hermit. Hmm.

Okay, so here’s what’s happening. You’re holding way too much already—like that Ten of Wands, reversed, screaming "drop the weight," but you haven’t. You’re stuck in this mental loop where you want to walk away from the chaos, but you’re still tangled in it. Then the Six of Cups shows up, pulling you back into old memories, nostalgia, maybe someone from your past or just a time when things felt simpler. But the Hermit? This card isn’t about reaching back. It’s about stepping back—solo, no distractions, no crowds—just you and your own headspace.

You knew before you said it: people around you aren’t on the same page. this energy reversed underneath this is a red flag. Collaboration? Nah, it’s more like people not showing up or doing their part. Maybe you’ve been trying to patch things up at work, or in a friendship, or even family. You’re putting in effort, but the energy’s not reciprocated. It’s draining. So the Hermit says, “Enough.” That’s the official “I’m going inward” card—the kind where you stop chasing external approval or fixing what’s broken for others.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. this energy lurking beneath this mass is interesting. It’s the energy of moving on, leaving heavy stuff behind, traveling toward calmer waters—but it’s not a sprint. It’s a slow, deliberate shift. So maybe you’re not quite ready to throw in the towel on everything just yet. You’re still figuring out the exit route. The Hermit’s presence is telling you to slow down, get clear. Not to run away from your responsibilities, but to sort through the brain fog and emotional clutter that’s been weighing you down.

You’re probably exhausted, right? Like that reversed Ten of Wands—it’s showing you’ve been carrying more than your share. Maybe you’ve been juggling work shifts, bills, relationship drama, or family obligations that keep piling up. And whatever this is, you’re done pretending it doesn’t affect you. The jaw might be tight, the stomach dropping, but you’re looking for a way out that doesn’t involve burning bridges or yelling at everyone.

The Hermit’s not about isolation as punishment. It’s about recalibrating. You’re pulling back, dialing down the noise, so you can hear what you really want. And don’t lie to yourself—you’re scared of what you might find when you do. But that’s the point. It’s time to get honest. This card almost dares you: “Are you ready to face yourself without distractions?”

It’s wild how the Six of Cups is still here, though, whispering about the past. Maybe you’re tempted to revisit old comforts, old people, old habits. But the Hermit is putting a pause on that. This isn’t a rewind moment. It’s a deep breath before you move on. What’s feeding this energy is a sense of being unrecognized or unsupported, like you’re stuck doing all the heavy lifting alone. You start to see that maybe the reasons you’ve been holding on are more about comfort than growth.

In the next 7 days, test this out. Take one small action toward solitude—not ghosting, but carving out quiet space. Turn off the phone for an hour, cancel a social event, or just sit with your thoughts and write down what feels real. It’ll be uncomfortable at first. That’s okay. This isn’t forever; it’s a phase where you get to ask, “What’s mine, and what’s not?”

You get it.

Page of Swords. Huh?? Okay, so here we go. This card is all about sharp observation and sudden clarity, but it’s not the “let’s be nice” version. Nope. This is the “call-it-out, no filter” type—think of it as the one who shows up unannounced, blindsides you with the truth, and leaves you scrambling to catch up. You knew this was coming, right? Like that text you didn’t want to see but opened anyway.

Look, the Ten of Wands reversed is hanging out in the background, showing you’re trying to drop the weight, but the Page of Swords says—hold up—you’re not quite clear on what you’re unloading or why. You might have thought, “I’m done, I’m free,” but this card says there’s still a mess to untangle. Maybe you dropped the wrong stuff? Or maybe you’re avoiding the hard call because it’s easier to hop on the nostalgia train with the Six of Cups. Yeah, that feels good—memories, old friends, the “what if” moments. But this energy? It’s telling you, stop living in the past or you’ll keep circling back to the same issues.

And here’s the kicker—The Hermit is right there, ready to sit you down and force some solo truth time. But the Page of Swords doesn’t want that slow, quiet vibe. No, this card is restless, impatient, scanning for secrets, and ready to spill the tea before you’ve even finished your coffee. You feel that itch to know what’s really going on beneath the surface. this energy reversed lurking below means teamwork is off balance—or maybe the collaboration you hoped for is crumbling because someone isn’t pulling their weight. That’s feeding this Page’s sharp edge. It’s like you’re trying to build something, but the foundation’s shaky, and this card is poking at the cracks.

Then, you’ve got this energy quietly carrying the idea of moving forward, but not without a sting. The Page of Swords says, “Wait, wait—what’s the real story here?” You’re caught between wanting to escape the struggle and needing to face the facts. This card brings that tension to a head. It’s the voice inside that’s suspicious of easy exits. Like, if you walk away now, what are you leaving behind that’ll catch up to you later?

You might be dealing with someone who’s being sneaky—or maybe you’re the one holding back info, trying to protect yourself. Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this. The Page of Swords doesn’t do well with secrets or half-truths. It demands full transparency, even if that means shaking up your comfort zone. If you keep dodging, this card will keep popping up, poking holes, forcing you to face what’s really happening.

So, what’s the move? Pay attention to the chatter in your head. Notice when you’re spinning a story that’s more convenient than true. This isn’t the time for wishful thinking or nostalgia. The Six of Cups might tempt you to rewind, but the Page says—look forward, but look sharp. Yes, The Hermit’s asking for quiet reflection, but don’t get stuck in your head. Use that energy to spot what’s real, not what you want to see.

If you’re trying to rebuild something with others, the reversed this energy says, check who’s actually contributing. Don’t carry all the weight alone like the Ten of Wands reversed suggests you want to. This card’s poking you to speak up, ask questions, and demand clarity. The Page of Swords is restless for answers and doesn’t have time for games.

You’re at a point where the truth isn’t optional anymore. It’s either you find it, lay it out, or keep spinning in circles. this energy wants you moving, but the Page warns: don’t move blind. Eyes wide open, questions ready.

Yeah.

Judgement, reversed. Huh?? Okay, so right off the bat, this one’s throwing shade on the whole “wake-up call” vibe. Like, you knew deep down something needed to change, but here we are—still stuck, not quite ready to answer the call or maybe just ignoring the damn alarm clock altogether. It’s that moment when your inner voice is yelling, but you keep hitting snooze, and it’s getting louder, but you’re pretending it’s background noise.

I’m seeing a strong resistance here—maybe even denial. Like, you’re carrying the weight of decisions you haven’t fully owned yet, or you’re sidestepping the reckoning that’s overdue. The Ten of Wands reversed is teasing that exhaustion, like you’re dropping some of those burdens, but not because you’ve made peace with them. More like you’re forced to because you can’t carry it anymore. But dropping the load doesn’t mean you’re clear or unblocked; it just means the pressure’s shifting, and the real work hasn’t started.

The Six of Cups in the spread reminds me of nostalgia, but with Judgement reversed, it’s more like you’re stuck in the past, replaying old scenes because it’s safer than facing what’s next. Don’t lie to yourself—have you caught yourself daydreaming about better “then” instead of stepping into better “now”? That’s the echo I’m getting. You might be longing for simpler times or old versions of yourself before the complications piled on, but that longing is a double-edged sword. It’s comforting, sure, but it also keeps you from moving forward.

And the supporting energies? this energy reversed plus this energy. Oh, this spells out the struggle loud and clear. The reversed this energy is showing a breakdown in teamwork or support. Maybe you’re feeling isolated, like you’re doing this alone or people around you aren’t pulling their weight. You’re stuck in this limbo—wanting to move forward but the foundation feels shaky. this energy is the promise of transition, but it’s a slow, uneasy crossing. You’re trying to leave something behind, but it’s not quite clean or fully done.

The Hermit pops up here, too, which is interesting. It’s like you’re in this solo mental space, trying to figure it out internally, but without Judgement upright pushing for clarity, that inner search is going in circles. The Page of Swords adds the sharp edge of curiosity, but maybe also impatience or defensiveness. You’re watching, analyzing, but it’s not quite cutting through the fog yet.

I’m telling you, this spread is brimming with that tension between wanting to evolve and staying stuck. You can feel the pull—your soul wants to shed old skins, but the fear or uncertainty or plain old stubbornness is holding you back. Judgement reversed is the gatekeeper who’s still waiting for you to step up and truly accept what needs to change.

And yeah, I get it. Facing the music is scary. It’s like standing in front of a mirror and not liking the reflection, but also not willing to change the angle or the light. But this pause? It’s not forever. The universe’s nudge is there, even if you’re turning your back right now.

You feeling this? Don’t rush it, but don’t stall either. That moment when you stop pretending and start owning is closer than you think. Anyway.

Okay, so here’s the thing: you’ve been carrying more than your fair share, and it’s not just physical weight or responsibilities. This is that heavy vibe that sticks in your chest when you try to speak up but something keeps holding you back. You caught this before you even said a word, didn’t you? That nagging feeling that the team’s not on the same page or you’re out here building alone. The reversed energy around collaboration is flashing a warning sign—either you’re not getting the support you need, or you’re not showing up the way you want to. Either way, it’s creating a weird disconnect that’s messing with your momentum.

And, okay, nostalgia’s playing a sneaky role too. That longing for simpler times, maybe a relationship or friendship that felt less complicated or a moment you wish you could rewind to. But here’s what’s tricky: dwelling there won’t help you cross the river to calmer waters. The cards are clear—there’s a transition moment happening, a move toward something new, but your focus is half-turned backward. You’re caught between wanting to revisit the past and needing to step into your own light with more independence.

Speaking of stepping into the light, the inner work has been relentless. You’ve been retreating to that quiet place inside, trying to figure out what’s your truth versus what’s everyone else’s noise. But watch out—sometimes that hermit energy can turn into a trap, isolating you just when you need a fresh perspective or a fresh set of eyes. And with all this mental energy buzzing, you might be overanalyzing every little thing, spinning your wheels instead of moving forward.

Here’s a kicker: judgment—yeah, that big call you’re waiting for or maybe resisting—feels stuck. Something’s holding you back from making that final leap, and it’s not just fear. It’s like you’re second-guessing your own call to action, maybe doubting your readiness or the clarity of your decision. Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was coming. That hesitation is part of the process, but don’t let it turn into a freeze.

So, what’s the move? Maybe it’s time to cut the noise—clear the mental fog and stop trying to carry everything alone. Reach out, ask for help even if it feels vulnerable, and let the people who care show up for you. That old familiar comfort isn’t where the answer lives anymore. You need to trust that the shift you’re heading toward is worth the awkward, uncertain steps.

You feeling this? It’s like you’ve been staring at the same options too long, waiting for a sign that you’re not alone in this. Spoiler: you’re not. The universe is telling you to start moving, even if it’s just one small action—a call, a message, a yes to a coffee invite. That’s how the stuck moment breaks.
