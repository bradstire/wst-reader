Hey Leo! <break time="2.9s" /> October’s winding down, and I’m picking up some old stuff trying to sneak back in. <break time="2.1s" /> You know that feeling when something that once felt sweet now just feels off? <break time="4.5s" /> Yeah, this energy is that. <break time="2.9s" /> It’s like you’re flicking through memories you thought you’d moved on from, but nope—they’re still there, messing with your head. <break time="3.7s" />

Six of Cups, reversed. Oh wow. <break time="2s" /> This card is shouting about nostalgia gone sideways. <break time="4.1s" /> You’re not just remembering the past; you’re stuck in it in a way that’s holding you back. <break time="9.9s" /> It’s not the warm, fuzzy kind of remembering where you smile and let it go. <break time="1.2s" /> No, it’s more like you keep rewinding a scene that should’ve ended a long time ago, but you’re still watching it, hoping for a different outcome. <break time="6.4s" /> The clarifiers here—this energy and this energy—are showing you’re trying to avoid hitting rock bottom and resisting change that’s necessary. <break time="2.2s" /> You don’t want to face the full truth of what ended or what needs to shift. <break time="1.1s" /> That’s why you’re caught in this loop.

I’m seeing someone either clinging to old feelings or maybe even an old person who keeps popping back up in your life. <break time="3.2s" /> It’s confusing because it’s not like you want to go back, but part of you hasn’t fully said goodbye. <break time="4.8s" /> You knew this already, right? <break time="2.9s" /> Those late-night texts or checking old photos even though it makes you feel worse? Classic sign. You’re holding onto something that’s not good for you, hoping it’ll feel right again. <break time="7.2s" /> But it’s not. The this energy, suggests you’re trying to avoid the pain, but by refusing to fully let go, you’re just delaying the inevitable. <break time="2.3s" /> This isn’t about forgetting the past; it’s about not letting it run your present.

And the this energy, is saying the cycle isn’t turning in your favor because you’re resisting change. <break time="7.1s" /> You want things to go back to how they were, but the universe isn’t offering a rewind button. <break time="1.5s" /> You’re stuck in this off-kilter loop where you want the past, but the past can’t give you what you need anymore. <break time="2.8s" /> You’re resisting the natural flow of things because it’s scary to move forward without that familiar comfort—even if that comfort was unhealthy.

Let me try to put this plainly: you’re trying to rewrite history in your head, but reality isn’t cooperating. <break time="2.3s" /> It’s like you’re stuck on a page that’s been torn out and taped back in. <break time="3.3s" /> You get it, right? <break time="2.2s" /> This isn’t about blaming anyone or feeling guilty. <break time="4.6s" /> It’s about you recognizing the pattern and deciding if you want to keep living in that mental rerun or actually step into something new. <break time="2.3s" /> You don’t have to make the leap today, but the cards are clear: the past isn’t your safe place anymore.

What’s tripping you up is that you associate the past with innocence or safety, but that’s the illusion breaking down. <break time="2.8s" /> The Six of Cups reversed is showing the cracks in that fantasy. <break time="4.4s" /> You might be romanticizing a time before the pain or the betrayal, but it wasn’t perfect. <break time="1.2s" /> You’re seeing the truth now, even if it hurts. That’s why the this energy reversed is here—it’s the slow process of healing, but you have to let the worst fall away first.

This energy is heavy. <break time="2.6s" /> It’s about breaking a habit of retreating into what’s comfortable instead of what’s healthy. <break time="6.6s" /> You’re scared, I get it. <break time="5.8s" /> Change feels like losing something important. <break time="4.7s" /> But what you’re really losing is a false sense of security. <break time="2.9s" /> The cards are saying if you keep clinging, you’ll keep spinning in the same spot. <break time="7.9s" /> That’s your reality check.

Okay. <break time="1s" /> Let me sit with that a second. <break time="4.1s" /> Yeah. <break time="3.3s" />

Nine of Cups, reversed. Oh wow.

Okay, so this one’s showing up like a flat tire right when you thought you had a smooth ride. <break time="2.9s" /> You were expecting satisfaction, that “made it” feeling, but nah—something’s off. <break time="8.7s" /> This isn’t about some small disappointment. It’s the kind that hits when the wish you made didn’t land or the goal you chased turns out to be less than what you wanted. <break time="2.7s" /> You knew before you said it out loud—this energy isn’t delivering the contentment you counted on.

The Six of Cups reversed was already shaking the foundation, right? <break time="5.3s" /> That one’s about nostalgia or clinging to the past. <break time="2.5s" /> Now, with the Nine of Cups flipped, it’s like you’re stuck between what you hoped would bring joy and the reality that it doesn’t anymore. <break time="6.2s" /> Maybe you thought revisiting old patterns or people would fill you up, but it’s empty. <break time="2.6s" /> You’re done with the reruns. The clarifiers are this energy reversed and this energy reversed.

Clarifiers: Ten of Swords, reversed | Wheel of Fortune, reversed. <break time="4.9s" />

Ten of Swords, reversed is telling me you’re not willing to stay down for the count. <break time="2.2s" /> You tried to avoid the worst-case scenario, maybe even pulled yourself off the floor quicker than expected. <break time="2.5s" /> But here’s the kicker—the Wheel of Fortune reversed says that momentum isn’t on your side yet. <break time="1.5s" /> It’s like you’re caught in a loop where the same disappointments play out, and the universe isn’t flipping the script for you just yet. <break time="3.9s" /> Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew that luck or fate wasn’t about to swoop in and fix this.

So what’s going on behaviorally? You’re probably replaying moments, trying to convince yourself the “happy ending” is around the corner. <break time="3s" /> You might be second-guessing your choices, or worse, staying in situations that feel familiar but don’t serve you anymore. <break time="2.1s" /> That’s the Six of Cups reversed rubbing salt in the wound—stuck in old emotional patterns that no longer satisfy.

I’m seeing resistance to change here. It’s like you’re aware the ride needs to end, but you’re clutching the handlebar too tight. <break time="2.3s" /> Maybe you’re waiting for someone else to decide the next move or hoping things will “just get better.” But the cards are clear: no new joy comes without pushing through this stalled energy.

Here’s a boundary script you might need: “I’m done pretending this works for me.” Say that out loud. <break time="2.4s" /> Watch what happens when you stop chasing a wish that’s not coming true. <break time="2.2s" /> This isn’t about giving up—it’s about clearing space for something real, not a replay of past dreams or half-measures.

And yes, you could try to force the wheel to turn. You might throw money or effort at the problem, hoping the tide changes. <break time="2.3s" /> That’s the mistake. The energy here says that won’t work. It’s not about grinding harder; it’s about shifting what you’re chasing.

This is a time when you’re learning to spot what’s really yours to control—and what’s not. <break time="3.5s" /> The past, the “good old days,” the imagined satisfaction—they’re not in your hands anymore. <break time="2s" /> You can’t rewind or reset what didn’t deliver. You can only decide to stop waiting for it.

Watch what you do this week. Don’t check the same profiles, don’t answer that same text, don’t rehearse the same apologies or promises. <break time="4.4s" /> You’re done with the reruns, remember? <break time="2.4s" /> The tension here is between what you want and what’s real. <break time="2.5s" /> The cards don’t sugarcoat it: satisfaction is blocked because you’re holding onto the wrong things.

Okay. <break time="4.4s" />

The Hermit, reversed. Huh??

Okay, here’s the thing. <break time="5.1s" /> This card pops up when someone’s supposed to be doing the solo work—quiet time, reflection, digging deep—and you’re... <break time="7.2s" /> not. You’re avoiding it, outright dodging the whole “go within” assignment. <break time="2.4s" /> It’s like you’ve been staring at the same options too long, but instead of choosing, you just freeze or run in circles. <break time="1.7s" /> You knew before you said it: you’re not ready to be that isolated or honest with yourself right now.

This is not the kind of hermit who’s chill, meditating on a mountaintop. <break time="4.2s" /> No. <break time="2.1s" /> This is the one who’s stuck in the dark, maybe even pretending the light doesn’t exist. <break time="7.9s" /> You’ve got that jaw tight, stomach drop feeling when you try to look inward, so instead, you’re pushing it away. <break time="3s" /> Maybe you’re scrolling on your phone, busying yourself with distractions, or just flat-out ignoring the quiet moments you need to face. <break time="10.6s" /> The clarifiers? this energy | this energy. Yeah, that’s a rough combo. <break time="2.2s" /> You’re trying to dodge an ending or some major shift, but it’s not working. <break time="6.1s" /> This energy’s flipping the script on you, but you’re resisting the change.

Look back for a second: the Six of Cups, reversed, and the Nine of Cups, reversed, are both about dissatisfaction with what you once wished for or thought would bring you joy. <break time="3.2s" /> You’re stuck in some nostalgia that doesn’t fit anymore, and yes, that wish fulfillment? It feels hollow. <break time="2.1s" /> So instead of stepping back and recalibrating, you’re just keeping your head down or pretending everything’s fine. <break time="5.9s" /> You’re not done with that past energy yet, but it’s not really serving you. <break time="7.5s" /> And this card is screaming, “You’re not going to find clarity by hiding.”

The other thing is, this reversed Hermit can mean you’re avoiding being alone because when you do, you see all the stuff you don’t want to admit. <break time="3.3s" /> Maybe you’re scared of what you’ll find—fear of loneliness, failure, or just not knowing what’s next for your relationships or money. <break time="3.3s" /> There’s a kind of stubbornness here. <break time="2.3s" /> It’s like you’re stuck in some loop, refusing to face the facts. <break time="2.6s" /> And don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was coming.

Here’s a practical check: in the next 24 hours, try a tiny step in the opposite direction. <break time="2.5s" /> Turn off distractions for five minutes. Sit with one question you’ve been ignoring. It doesn’t have to be a life overhaul—just a little peek at what’s really going on. <break time="2.8s" /> You’ll feel the tension in your jaw or stomach, sure. <break time="2.7s" /> That’s normal. But this isn’t forever; this is a phase you have to pass through to get to something better.

The clarifiers add weight to the idea that you’re dodging an ending or a shift that’s overdue. <break time="1.4s" /> this energy reversed says you’re in the recovery phase, but you’re not quite healed. <break time="3.1s" /> this energy reversed points to stuck cycles or bad timing, so your resistance is holding you back from the reset you need. <break time="10.7s" /> This isn’t about luck; it’s about your choice to engage or not.

So you’re caught between wanting to heal and not wanting to face the mess first. <break time="5.1s" /> That’s where the energy is. You’re not crazy for feeling that way. <break time="3s" /> But if you keep running, you’ll just end up in the same spot, same frustration. <break time="8.5s" /> You get it.

Mm. <break time="3.2s" />

Six of Pentacles. Oh wow.

Alright, this one’s about give and take — but not the easy kind. <break time="2.7s" /> You’re standing there, maybe holding out a hand, maybe expecting one to be held out to you. <break time="2.9s" /> This card’s about balance, sure, but right now? <break time="1.9s" /> That balance feels shaky, because of what’s around it. <break time="3s" /> You’ve got the Six of Cups reversed at the start — that’s your past messing with your sense of fairness, like old wounds or nostalgia getting in the way of what’s real now. <break time="2.6s" /> You wanted sweetness, but it’s souring. <break time="2.5s" /> Then toss in the Nine of Cups reversed — your wishes? Not coming true. Satisfaction? Slipping through your fingers. You knew before you said it: you’re not getting the emotional payoff you expected. <break time="2.5s" /> And The Hermit reversed? <break time="3s" /> Isolation, but forced. <break time="2.7s" /> You’re stuck in that headspace, turning away from the help or clarity you need.

So, Six of Pentacles shows up here, and it’s not the straightforward charity card. <break time="6.6s" /> It’s more complicated. You might be dealing with someone who’s offering help, but it feels like a transaction or a power play. <break time="1.8s" /> Or maybe you’re the one giving, but you’re tired of the strings attached. <break time="3.8s" /> Clarifiers? this energy reversed and this energy reversed. <break time="2.5s" /> That tells me this isn’t a fresh start or a clean break. <break time="2.9s" /> No, you’re in a place where you’re trying to avoid a total collapse, trying to recover from a betrayal or a betrayal in progress. <break time="2s" /> The Wheel says the cycle isn’t turning your way yet. <break time="7.8s" /> You’re caught in a loop of imbalance.

Look, if you’re waiting for someone to step up and share equally, you’re waiting. <break time="9.3s" /> If you’re the one giving, check yourself: are you really ready to keep pouring into a situation that’s not returning? <break time="2.5s" /> You might be masking exhaustion with generosity. <break time="1.8s" /> It’s okay to say no. <break time="6.2s" /> Don’t lie to yourself — you already knew this wasn’t about pure kindness. <break time="10.1s" /> It’s about control, or debt, or keeping score. <break time="2.6s" /> The energy around this card is heavy with that “giving but watching closely” vibe.

You’re probably juggling feelings here, right? <break time="3s" /> The Six of Cups reversed says you want the old warmth back, but the Nine of Cups reversed reminds you that the old dreams are broken. <break time="2.2s" /> The Hermit reversed is your mind telling you, “Stop hiding. <break time="2.6s" /> Face the mess.” And this card? It’s the practical fallout of that. Money, favors, emotional labor — none of it is free. <break time="6.4s" /> Someone’s paying, someone’s receiving, and someone’s keeping tabs.

For some of you, this might be about money or loans. <break time="7.9s" /> For others, it’s favors or emotional support. Maybe you gave more than you should’ve. Maybe you’re waiting for a “thank you” that never comes. <break time="9.7s" /> The clarifiers hint that you’re recovering from pain but stuck in the same spot. <break time="9.2s" /> You’re not moving forward because the cycle hasn’t flipped yet.

You could test the water here: if they wanted to share, they would. <break time="4.9s" /> If they wanted to balance things out, it’d be happening already. <break time="3.3s" /> If you keep waiting, you’re just feeding that wheel—reinforcing the pattern. <break time="2.7s" /> So what’s your move? Boundaries. You keep your hands open, but don’t offer more than you can afford to lose. <break time="3s" /> Protect your energy, your money, your peace.

Watch out for the temptation to feel guilty about it. <break time="2.7s" /> That’s the trap. You’re not a bank. You’re not a charity. You’re a person who deserves fair exchange. That’s it.

Yeah. <break time="3.4s" />

Two of Swords, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so right off the bat, this card’s energy is like you’re finally dropping the blindfold you didn’t even know you were wearing. <break time="2.1s" /> You feel that? <break time="2.2s" /> That moment when the “I don’t want to see” shifts into “I can’t pretend anymore.” You knew before you said it, or maybe you didn’t want to admit it to yourself, but that indecision? It’s unraveling. <break time="2.3s" /> You’re not sitting on the fence anymore because the fence is starting to wobble under your own weight.

But here’s the thing — this isn’t about some neat epiphany where everything lines up perfectly. <break time="2s" /> No, it’s messy. <break time="2.2s" /> It’s like when you’ve been staring at the same two choices for so long you start imagining neither is good, but the truth is, the universe’s handshake is firm and clear now: it’s time to pick a side. <break time="3.5s" /> You can’t keep playing that “too scared to move” game with your own heart or your head. <break time="3.7s" /> The card’s flipped, and it’s shouting, “Enough.”

And don’t get it twisted: this isn’t about a sudden burst of confidence. <break time="2.4s" /> It’s more like a slow-burning exhaustion from ignoring that nagging feeling in your gut that’s been screaming, “This isn’t working.” Maybe you’ve been stuck in a loop with the Six of Cups reversed—nostalgia or old comfort zones that aren’t really comfort anymore. <break time="2.1s" /> Or maybe the Nine of Cups reversed has been whispering about unmet wishes, like you’re trying to fill a glass that’s already cracked. <break time="2.7s" /> Now, with the Two of Swords flipped, that stuckness is cracking wide open.

But wait — before you dive headfirst into making a decision, Spirit’s throwing the this energy reversed and this energy reversed into the mix. <break time="1.1s" /> This isn’t the universe telling you it’s all smooth sailing from here. <break time="5.1s" /> No, it’s more like a warning sign flashing: “Yeah, the pain might ease up, but that doesn’t mean the tides have turned just yet.” You’re stepping off the fence, but the ground beneath might still be shaky. <break time="3.7s" /> You’re not trading one locked door for another—you’re just choosing which door to open first.

And this whole vibe? It’s less about clarity and more about surrendering to not having all the answers. <break time="2.9s" /> The Hermit reversed is screaming about avoiding isolation or refusing to turn inward when you really should. <break time="2.2s" /> This suggests you might be tempted to dodge the deeper questions by rushing into a decision just to get it over with. <break time="1.7s" /> Watch that impulse. There’s a difference between moving forward and running away from your own shadow.

Then there’s the Six of Pentacles—balance, fairness, giving and receiving. <break time="2.3s" /> That’s your anchor here. Don’t just choose a side blindly; make sure what you’re stepping into feels reciprocal. <break time="2.4s" /> If one side’s asking too much without giving back, you’re just signing up for another round of imbalance. <break time="3s" /> The Two of Swords reversed is the nudge to stop pretending both options are equal. <break time="4.9s" /> Spoiler: they’re not. Your instincts are probably already leaning one way, even if your mind is scrambling to justify the other. <break time="4.7s" /> You’re allowed to admit that.

You feeling this? <break time="2.8s" /> It’s a moment where you’re forced to look at your own boundaries and maybe even redraw them. <break time="2.6s" /> You can’t keep settling for halfway solutions or pretending you’re fine with things being in limbo. <break time="1.6s" /> That limbo’s been a mask — and you’re letting it fall. <break time="2.5s" /> The question is, what do you do with the space that opens up after?

Anyway.

Wait—no. <break time="4.7s" /> This energy is not about wrapping things up neatly. <break time="4.9s" /> You caught the vibe: there’s hesitation, a refusal to look inward the way you should. <break time="2s" /> That moment when you want to retreat to your corner, but the corner’s been knocked over. <break time="2.4s" /> That’s the reversed hermit’s jam. <break time="3.1s" /> You’re not avoiding the silence because you love it; you’re dodging the hard questions that come with it. <break time="5.6s" /> And you knew before you said it—there’s a block on feeling fulfilled, like the universe handed you a wish list, and then flipped the lights off on the whole thing. <break time="5.5s" /> The satisfaction you expected? <break time="2.7s" /> It’s sitting on the sidelines, arms crossed, looking like it’s done waiting.

This isn’t about nostalgia or sweet memories, either. <break time="3.6s" /> That reversed energy around childhood comfort or past connections isn’t the warm hug you wanted. <break time="1.8s" /> It’s more like an echo in a room that’s lost its furniture—there’s something missing, and it’s not coming back the way you hoped. <break time="6s" /> Maybe you’re holding onto an image of how things should be, but reality’s saying, “Nope, not this time.”

And speaking of “nope,” the money or balance side of this is tricky. <break time="7s" /> There’s a push and pull with give-and-take — but not the equal kind. <break time="2.1s" /> It’s more like the scales are stuck, and someone’s been holding out, maybe even you. <break time="8.5s" /> The clarifier here, that stubborn reversal, says the wheel’s not turning for you right now. <break time="7.1s" /> You’re caught in a loop of the same patterns, the same disappointments, even when you try to hand things off or accept help. <break time="2s" /> It’s frustrating because you want change, but change’s door is stuck.

Now, the decision-making? Yeah, that’s a mess. <break time="2.4s" /> The energy around the two of swords reversed is like standing in front of a door with no key and no idea which way to push. <break time="2.9s" /> You might feel like you’re choosing, but really you’re just spinning in place, overwhelmed by options or fears. <break time="6.9s" /> You’re seeing the stakes, but the clarity? <break time="2s" /> It’s hiding behind that mess of indecision and the fear of making a wrong move. <break time="6.1s" /> And don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was coming.

Here’s the kicker: that near end, the one you think means collapse or disaster, it’s flipped. <break time="4.5s" /> The worst is over, or maybe it didn’t even happen the way you imagined. <break time="2s" /> There’s a chance to breathe without the weight crushing down. <break time="8s" /> But the catch is, the wheel still won’t budge. <break time="2.4s" /> So, you’re standing there with a broken compass, no map, and the clock ticking louder than ever.

So what’s next? <break time="2.7s" /> It’s not about fixing everything at once or pretending you’re okay. <break time="2.5s" /> It’s about calling someone—maybe just one person who gets it—and laying it out. <break time="2.5s" /> A quick text, a call, a message that says, “I’m here, but barely.” Because sometimes the first crack in the wall is all you need to start something shifting.
