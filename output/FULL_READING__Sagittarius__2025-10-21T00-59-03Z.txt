Hey Sagittarius, October’s already halfway gone, and I’m getting that restless vibe from you. Like you’re sitting on something, but you’re not sure if you should spill or keep it zipped. It’s one of those days where the usual feels off, but you don’t know why yet. You’re scanning the room, but nobody’s saying the words you need to hear. Mm. Okay.

The Empress, reversed. Oh wow. This one’s heavy. We’re not talking about nurturing energy flowing freely here. Nope. This is more like the well’s run dry or someone took the green light away from your plans. You probably started something—maybe a project, a relationship, or even a new habit—and now it’s stuck. Not growing, not thriving, just... paused. And that’s frustrating because you invested time, effort, maybe even feelings. You see the potential, but it’s like the Universe slammed the brakes. You’re sitting there, tapping your foot, wondering why nothing’s moving forward.

Wait, I’m picking up on something else. This isn’t just about external blocks. There’s a part of you holding back, too. Maybe you’re scared to fully commit or afraid of what success would actually mean. Like, you want the growth, but you’re also worried it’ll change everything—your comfort zone, your vibe, your control. That’s classic Empress reversed territory. So you’re stuck between wanting more and being too cautious to go for it. You feel me?

And here’s the kicker: this card is also about self-care gone sideways. Are you really taking care of yourself, or are you pretending everything’s fine while running on empty? Because that’s what it’s showing me. You might be overextending, putting everyone else first, and leaving your own needs on the back burner. That can kill creativity and motivation fast. You can’t pour from an empty cup, Sagittarius. You knew that before you even asked.

Oh, and before I forget—this card also points to some kind of blockage in abundance. Not just money, but energy, time, attention. Something is stuck, and it’s making you question your worth or the value of what you’re trying to build. That’s a low-key pressure cooker. You’re like, “Why bother if it’s not happening?” But you’re not done yet. Not by a long shot.

Let me sit with this energy a second. Yeah, okay. This Empress reversed is pushing you to check your roots—your habits, mindset, and how you treat yourself. There’s no easy fix here. It’s a nudge to get honest, even if the truth’s uncomfortable. Because if you keep ignoring the cracks, nothing will grow. You get it?

So. We’re in that tricky spot where things are supposed to bloom but aren’t. You’re feeling stuck and maybe a little lost on how to flip the switch. But there’s also a hidden invitation here—to rethink what nurturing means for you. Not just others, but you. That’s the real deal.

Hm. Okay.

Two of Wands, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so right off the bat, this card is yelling “pause.” You’re staring at a choice or a plan, but you’re stuck. Not because you don’t want to move forward, no—it’s more like you’re second-guessing every step. Maybe you’ve got options lined up, but none of them feel right. You knew this was coming; you probably said it out loud or texted someone about it last night—“I don’t know if this is the right move.” Yeah. That hesitation? It’s real. And it’s loud.

This card’s not about action; it’s about indecision that’s become a block. You’re holding the globe, but it’s slipping through your fingers. Not ‘cause you don’t want to take control, but because the fear of making the wrong choice is freezing you. Oh, you told yourself to trust the process, but you’re scrolling through every possible outcome and none of them sit well. You’re in that limbo where every plan looks like it’s missing something crucial.

Wait—no. It’s not just fear; it’s frustration. You’ve been trying to get ahead, but the energy around this is sticky. Could be work, could be money, maybe a relationship where you’re waiting on a sign that never comes. You’re done with waiting, but it’s like your options are on mute. You’re ready to act, but the moment to move is elusive. You’re overthinking, spinning the wheel, but not hitting “go.” This card shows that exact stuck feeling.

Mm-hm, and here’s the kicker: you know you’re the one holding yourself back. Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this. The problem isn’t the choices; it’s the doubt sitting heavy on your chest. You’ve been staring at the same options too long, and it’s draining your fire. You want clarity, but what you’re getting is noise. That’s the energy here.

Okay, so what’s the energy asking? It’s not about rushing. It’s about tuning in to what’s real and what’s fear talking. This is not the time to force a decision or jump just because you feel pressured. You’re better off sitting with the discomfort a bit longer, even if it sucks. That’s the key to shifting this. It’s like you’ve got all the tools but none are working yet. You’re almost there, just not quite. Spirit’s telling you to breathe through the messiness.

Alright, listen — you probably don’t want to hear this, but the ball’s in your court, and you’re the one who needs to stop running in circles. You have to face what’s holding you back instead of scrolling past it. It’s not about the outside world crashing down; it’s the inside world needing some serious sorting. You’ve got to break the loop.

This is shifting now.

The Hanged Man, reversed. Sheesh. Okay, so this one’s a little different upside down. Usually, you think of the Hanged Man as the pause card, right? The one where you sit back, wait, maybe sacrifice a little for the bigger picture. But flipped? It’s like that pause got cut short or ignored. No waiting around. No surrender. You’re pushing against the hold-up.

Here’s what’s screaming: you already knew you weren’t gonna sit this one out quietly. You’re restless. Maybe even frustrated. Like you’ve been stuck in a routine or a situation that’s supposed to teach you patience or perspective, but you’re done playing that game. You’re trying to force things forward. I’m seeing someone who’s tapped out on waiting for clarity or for others to catch up. You jumped off the sidelines, maybe before you fully understood the consequences. That’s the reversed Hanged Man for you—acting with a kind of impatience that can backfire.

This card’s about effort, but not the smooth, easy kind. More like banging your head against the wall because you think pushing harder will break it down faster. That energy? It’s messy. You might have been told to “let it be” or “trust the process,” but you’re like, “Nah, I got this.” But watch out—sometimes rushing means missing the point completely. You could be ignoring what your gut’s really trying to show you because you’re in such a hurry to move on.

And in work or daily grind terms? Maybe you’re running on empty trying to fix something that needs a break or a new angle. Like redoing the same project with more force instead of stepping back and reassessing. Or you’re stuck juggling too many responsibilities, refusing to drop anything, and it’s burning you out. Maybe your routine feels like a trap, but instead of changing it, you’re just pushing harder, hoping to escape. That’s a dead end.

In relationships, this card flipped is the red flag waving. It’s the “I’m done waiting for you to change” or “I’m tired of pretending I’m okay with this.” You might’ve been stuck in a stalemate, but the reversal says you’re ready to break free, even if it means shaking things up or making a mess. You probably already clocked that dynamic—you’re not fooling yourself here. It’s raw honesty, whether it’s with your partner, friends, or family. But heads up: breaking free without fully understanding why you felt stuck could lead to regrets. You’re acting on impulse, not insight.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. This card also warns about stubbornness disguised as strength. You’re not just moving forward—you’re refusing to bend, even when bending might save you time or heartache. It’s like you’ve got all the tools but none are clicking because you’re forcing the fit. Don’t lie to yourself—you already know this. You’ve felt that itch, that gnawing feeling that says, “What if I’m skipping a step?” 

But hey, the upside is clear—you’re not passive. You’re not waiting for life to hand you meaning or direction. You’re grabbing it, even if it’s a little reckless. That fire? It’s your power, just gotta channel it right. No more sitting on the sidelines or pretending the stall is okay.

Okay, so what’s next? You feeling this? Are you ready to pause for real, or are you gonna keep pushing until something breaks? The Hanged Man reversed is calling you out—stop pretending patience is your style if it’s not. You’re all about action, but that action needs a better target. You get it.

The Seven of Swords, reversed. Huh??

Okay, this one’s a trip. You’re staring at a card that’s all about the stuff you thought you could sneak past—secrets, lies, maybe even dodging responsibility. But reversed? It’s like the mask fell off. You’re not sneaking anywhere anymore. There’s a moment where you’re caught standing there, hands empty, and the truth’s just sitting on the table, no place to hide. Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked this before the card showed up. Maybe you tried to play it cool, keep your moves private, but something slipped. Or maybe you’re the one who got played.

Mm. Here’s the thing: the reversed Seven of Swords doesn’t let you off the hook with a clean getaway. It’s telling you that whatever you were avoiding, it’s time to face it head-on. That trick you pulled? The one you thought was slick? It’s unraveling. And yeah, it hurts because the fallout hits close—trust, respect, or your own self-image. That’s the kicker. You might’ve thought you were the clever one, but now you’re dealing with the fallout of being caught, or worse, realizing you can’t outrun your own conscience. Maybe it’s a relationship where the truth’s out, or a situation at work where you tried to cut corners, and now the cracks are showing.

Wait—no. Actually, this card also flips the script on you. It’s not just about being caught by others; it’s about being honest with yourself. You might be the last person to admit you’re holding back or hiding something. This card’s prodding you—no, forcing you—to drop the act. That’s why it feels rough. Because you’re not just exposing a secret to someone else; you’re exposing it to yourself. And that’s way harder. The reversed Seven of Swords is like your inner alarm going off, screaming, “Stop lying to yourself.” You feeling this? It’s that gut punch where you have to decide: keep pretending, or own the mess and clean it up.

Sheesh. This could be about any area—family, friends, your side hustle, even your living situation. Maybe you’ve been sneaking around, dodging conversations, or avoiding bills. If you’ve been tiptoeing around something big, this card’s the wake-up call. It’s like the universe saying, “You can’t keep running in circles.” And no, it’s not about shame—it’s about realignment. The kind that demands you put your cards on the table and deal with whatever’s there, no filters.

Okay, so if you’re feeling the sting, that’s normal. Because this card doesn’t sugarcoat the truth. It’s raw, and sometimes brutal. But that’s the point. You knew this was coming, even if you didn’t want to admit it. Now it’s here. The good news? Once you stop hiding, you can start fixing. You get to decide what comes next, but it starts with dropping the act. No more sneaking. No more sidestepping. It’s on the table now.

Alright, guys. What’s next feels like a choice between moving on or getting stuck in the fallout. You get it.

The Magician, reversed. Huh??

Okay, here’s the thing. This card’s not about you pulling off some slick magic trick today. No, it’s more like you grabbed a handful of tools but none of them are clicking right now. You knew this was a glitch before you even said it out loud. You’ve been trying to make moves, but something’s off—the energy’s flat, the usual spark missing.

I’m seeing a block, or maybe a straight-up stall. You’ve got ideas, plans, even that fire, but the connection to making it real? Kinda dead. Like trying to light a match that just won’t catch. You might be overthinking or doubting yourself. Maybe you’re waiting for the “perfect moment” that isn’t coming. That hesitation? It’s costing you time and momentum. You feel it, don’t lie. You’re stuck holding onto half-baked plans or outdated scripts that don’t work anymore.

Now, this isn’t about losing your mojo forever. It’s about taking a hard look at what’s really in your hands versus what you think you have. You’ve been juggling a few things—money, work, maybe some side projects—but are you actually using what’s in front of you? Or is it all just flash without substance? The reversed Magician calls out that gap. You might be selling yourself short or waiting for a sign that’s not coming.

Also, watch for distractions. This card’s whispering “stop chasing shiny objects.” You know the type—new apps, fresh ideas, random side hustles that promise everything but deliver nada. That’s the energy sucking your juice dry. It’s like you’re trying to cook dinner with empty pots. You’ve got the skills, but your ingredients? Missing.

And here’s the kicker: confidence isn’t just about feeling good. It’s about showing up with what you’ve got and making it work. The reversed Magician says you’re not fooling anyone—not even yourself—if you keep pretending all systems are go when they’re not. You’re running on empty but acting like you’ve got full tanks. That’s why results aren’t showing. You knew it before this card popped.

So what now? You need to stop faking it till you make it and actually make it happen. That means stripping down the noise, dumping what’s dead weight, and focusing on one real move. No more juggling 10 things at once hoping one sticks. You’ve got to pick one clear focus and put all your energy there, even if it feels scary. Because half-assed effort equals zero progress.

I’m also seeing some trust issues with your own skills. Like, you doubt your power to create the change you want. That’s the real block here. The Magician reversed calls BS on that. You have everything inside you, but you’re letting fear freeze your hands. Stop giving the universe excuses to stay quiet. You don’t need a sign; you need action.

Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this. You’ve been staring at the same options too long, waiting for something to flip. But flipping the switch isn’t about waiting anymore. It’s about flipping your mindset first. That means ditching the self-doubt and stepping into your power, even if it’s messy. Because right now, the mess is better than the freeze.

Alright, guys. Time to get real with what you’ve got and stop lying about what you don’t. The presence’s waiting for you to show up—not perfectly, just honestly. You get it.

Okay, so you’re sitting with this tension that’s been hanging just under the surface. It’s the kind of undertone where you’re halfway between standing your ground and wondering if you should just let the whole thing slide. You knew before you said it, and that’s the kicker—you already clocked this wasn’t going to be easy. Maybe it’s about a relationship where the words are heavy, but no one’s really willing to say the whole truth. Or money conversations that keep circling without landing anywhere solid. That moment where you want to push for clarity but feel the weight of what might break if you do.

Wait—no, don’t think of it as breaking. Think of it more like shifting. This undertone is asking you to examine what’s been quietly simmering, the stuff you’ve been avoiding because it’s uncomfortable. That’s why you might feel stuck or like you’re looking at the same options too long. When someone’s not showing up fully, or the numbers don’t add up, or that feeling that your routine isn’t serving you anymore—this is what you’re dealing with. 

And here’s the thing: there’s a subtle insistence in this space. It’s not a loud shout but a persistent tap. You’ve got to decide what boundaries you’re setting and what you’re willing to tolerate. Not the “I’m just gonna ghost” kind of boundary, but the “I’m showing up knowing what I want and what I won’t take” kind. You feel like you’re carrying the weight of others’ expectations, but this is your moment to recognize where you’re carrying too much. 

Okay, so here’s where this gets real. You’re being invited to get honest with yourself about what’s really serving you. This could be a call you need to make, a conversation you’ve been avoiding, or even the decision to walk away from something that’s just draining your current. It’s not about closure; it’s about clearing space for what actually matters. And yeah, that may mean standing in some discomfort for a little while, but it’s necessary. You’re doing yourself a favor by not pretending to be okay when you’re not.

Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked that the way things have been isn’t sustainable. Now it’s about turning that recognition into action, even if it feels messy or incomplete. Maybe that means setting your phone down, taking a breath, and writing down what you really want without editing yourself. Or maybe it’s reaching out to someone who’s been on your mind but you’ve been hesitant to contact.

I’m seeing a lot of collective influence around reclaiming control, even if it’s just a tiny piece right now. You’re not waiting for the perfect moment because you know that moment might never come. Instead, you’re creating a small crack where light can get through. That’s a powerful move.
