Hey Leo! October’s winding down, and I’m picking up some old stuff trying to sneak back in. You know that feeling when something that once felt sweet now just feels off? Yeah, this energy is that. It’s like you’re flicking through memories you thought you’d moved on from, but nope—they’re still there, messing with your head.

Six of Cups, reversed. Oh wow. This card is shouting about nostalgia gone sideways. You’re not just remembering the past; you’re stuck in it in a way that’s holding you back. It’s not the warm, fuzzy kind of remembering where you smile and let it go. No, it’s more like you keep rewinding a scene that should’ve ended a long time ago, but you’re still watching it, hoping for a different outcome. The clarifiers here—this energy and this energy—are showing you’re trying to avoid hitting rock bottom and resisting change that’s necessary. You don’t want to face the full truth of what ended or what needs to shift. That’s why you’re caught in this loop.

I’m seeing someone either clinging to old feelings or maybe even an old person who keeps popping back up in your life. It’s confusing because it’s not like you want to go back, but part of you hasn’t fully said goodbye. You knew this already, right? Those late-night texts or checking old photos even though it makes you feel worse? Classic sign. You’re holding onto something that’s not good for you, hoping it’ll feel right again. But it’s not. The this energy, suggests you’re trying to avoid the pain, but by refusing to fully let go, you’re just delaying the inevitable. This isn’t about forgetting the past; it’s about not letting it run your present.

And the this energy, is saying the cycle isn’t turning in your favor because you’re resisting change. You want things to go back to how they were, but the universe isn’t offering a rewind button. You’re stuck in this off-kilter loop where you want the past, but the past can’t give you what you need anymore. You’re resisting the natural flow of things because it’s scary to move forward without that familiar comfort—even if that comfort was unhealthy.

Let me try to put this plainly: you’re trying to rewrite history in your head, but reality isn’t cooperating. It’s like you’re stuck on a page that’s been torn out and taped back in. You get it, right? This isn’t about blaming anyone or feeling guilty. It’s about you recognizing the pattern and deciding if you want to keep living in that mental rerun or actually step into something new. You don’t have to make the leap today, but the cards are clear: the past isn’t your safe place anymore.

What’s tripping you up is that you associate the past with innocence or safety, but that’s the illusion breaking down. The Six of Cups reversed is showing the cracks in that fantasy. You might be romanticizing a time before the pain or the betrayal, but it wasn’t perfect. You’re seeing the truth now, even if it hurts. That’s why the this energy reversed is here—it’s the slow process of healing, but you have to let the worst fall away first.

This energy is heavy. It’s about breaking a habit of retreating into what’s comfortable instead of what’s healthy. You’re scared, I get it. Change feels like losing something important. But what you’re really losing is a false sense of security. The cards are saying if you keep clinging, you’ll keep spinning in the same spot. That’s your reality check.

Okay. Let me sit with that a second. Yeah.

Nine of Cups, reversed. Oh wow.

Okay, so this one’s showing up like a flat tire right when you thought you had a smooth ride. You were expecting satisfaction, that “made it” feeling, but nah—something’s off. This isn’t about some small disappointment. It’s the kind that hits when the wish you made didn’t land or the goal you chased turns out to be less than what you wanted. You knew before you said it out loud—this energy isn’t delivering the contentment you counted on.

The Six of Cups reversed was already shaking the foundation, right? That one’s about nostalgia or clinging to the past. Now, with the Nine of Cups flipped, it’s like you’re stuck between what you hoped would bring joy and the reality that it doesn’t anymore. Maybe you thought revisiting old patterns or people would fill you up, but it’s empty. You’re done with the reruns. The clarifiers are this energy reversed and this energy reversed.

Clarifiers: Ten of Swords, reversed | Wheel of Fortune, reversed.

Ten of Swords, reversed is telling me you’re not willing to stay down for the count. You tried to avoid the worst-case scenario, maybe even pulled yourself off the floor quicker than expected. But here’s the kicker—the Wheel of Fortune reversed says that momentum isn’t on your side yet. It’s like you’re caught in a loop where the same disappointments play out, and the universe isn’t flipping the script for you just yet. Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew that luck or fate wasn’t about to swoop in and fix this.

So what’s going on behaviorally? You’re probably replaying moments, trying to convince yourself the “happy ending” is around the corner. You might be second-guessing your choices, or worse, staying in situations that feel familiar but don’t serve you anymore. That’s the Six of Cups reversed rubbing salt in the wound—stuck in old emotional patterns that no longer satisfy.

I’m seeing resistance to change here. It’s like you’re aware the ride needs to end, but you’re clutching the handlebar too tight. Maybe you’re waiting for someone else to decide the next move or hoping things will “just get better.” But the cards are clear: no new joy comes without pushing through this stalled energy.

Here’s a boundary script you might need: “I’m done pretending this works for me.” Say that out loud. Watch what happens when you stop chasing a wish that’s not coming true. This isn’t about giving up—it’s about clearing space for something real, not a replay of past dreams or half-measures.

And yes, you could try to force the wheel to turn. You might throw money or effort at the problem, hoping the tide changes. That’s the mistake. The energy here says that won’t work. It’s not about grinding harder; it’s about shifting what you’re chasing.

This is a time when you’re learning to spot what’s really yours to control—and what’s not. The past, the “good old days,” the imagined satisfaction—they’re not in your hands anymore. You can’t rewind or reset what didn’t deliver. You can only decide to stop waiting for it.

Watch what you do this week. Don’t check the same profiles, don’t answer that same text, don’t rehearse the same apologies or promises. You’re done with the reruns, remember? The tension here is between what you want and what’s real. The cards don’t sugarcoat it: satisfaction is blocked because you’re holding onto the wrong things.

Okay.

The Hermit, reversed. Huh??

Okay, here’s the thing. This card pops up when someone’s supposed to be doing the solo work—quiet time, reflection, digging deep—and you’re... not. You’re avoiding it, outright dodging the whole “go within” assignment. It’s like you’ve been staring at the same options too long, but instead of choosing, you just freeze or run in circles. You knew before you said it: you’re not ready to be that isolated or honest with yourself right now.

This is not the kind of hermit who’s chill, meditating on a mountaintop. No. This is the one who’s stuck in the dark, maybe even pretending the light doesn’t exist. You’ve got that jaw tight, stomach drop feeling when you try to look inward, so instead, you’re pushing it away. Maybe you’re scrolling on your phone, busying yourself with distractions, or just flat-out ignoring the quiet moments you need to face. The clarifiers? this energy | this energy. Yeah, that’s a rough combo. You’re trying to dodge an ending or some major shift, but it’s not working. This energy’s flipping the script on you, but you’re resisting the change.

Look back for a second: the Six of Cups, reversed, and the Nine of Cups, reversed, are both about dissatisfaction with what you once wished for or thought would bring you joy. You’re stuck in some nostalgia that doesn’t fit anymore, and yes, that wish fulfillment? It feels hollow. So instead of stepping back and recalibrating, you’re just keeping your head down or pretending everything’s fine. You’re not done with that past energy yet, but it’s not really serving you. And this card is screaming, “You’re not going to find clarity by hiding.”

The other thing is, this reversed Hermit can mean you’re avoiding being alone because when you do, you see all the stuff you don’t want to admit. Maybe you’re scared of what you’ll find—fear of loneliness, failure, or just not knowing what’s next for your relationships or money. There’s a kind of stubbornness here. It’s like you’re stuck in some loop, refusing to face the facts. And don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was coming.

Here’s a practical check: in the next 24 hours, try a tiny step in the opposite direction. Turn off distractions for five minutes. Sit with one question you’ve been ignoring. It doesn’t have to be a life overhaul—just a little peek at what’s really going on. You’ll feel the tension in your jaw or stomach, sure. That’s normal. But this isn’t forever; this is a phase you have to pass through to get to something better.

The clarifiers add weight to the idea that you’re dodging an ending or a shift that’s overdue. this energy reversed says you’re in the recovery phase, but you’re not quite healed. this energy reversed points to stuck cycles or bad timing, so your resistance is holding you back from the reset you need. This isn’t about luck; it’s about your choice to engage or not.

So you’re caught between wanting to heal and not wanting to face the mess first. That’s where the energy is. You’re not crazy for feeling that way. But if you keep running, you’ll just end up in the same spot, same frustration. You get it. 

Mm.

Six of Pentacles. Oh wow. 

Alright, this one’s about give and take — but not the easy kind. You’re standing there, maybe holding out a hand, maybe expecting one to be held out to you. This card’s about balance, sure, but right now? That balance feels shaky, because of what’s around it. You’ve got the Six of Cups reversed at the start — that’s your past messing with your sense of fairness, like old wounds or nostalgia getting in the way of what’s real now. You wanted sweetness, but it’s souring. Then toss in the Nine of Cups reversed — your wishes? Not coming true. Satisfaction? Slipping through your fingers. You knew before you said it: you’re not getting the emotional payoff you expected. And The Hermit reversed? Isolation, but forced. You’re stuck in that headspace, turning away from the help or clarity you need. 

So, Six of Pentacles shows up here, and it’s not the straightforward charity card. It’s more complicated. You might be dealing with someone who’s offering help, but it feels like a transaction or a power play. Or maybe you’re the one giving, but you’re tired of the strings attached. Clarifiers? this energy reversed and this energy reversed. That tells me this isn’t a fresh start or a clean break. No, you’re in a place where you’re trying to avoid a total collapse, trying to recover from a betrayal or a betrayal in progress. The Wheel says the cycle isn’t turning your way yet. You’re caught in a loop of imbalance.

Look, if you’re waiting for someone to step up and share equally, you’re waiting. If you’re the one giving, check yourself: are you really ready to keep pouring into a situation that’s not returning? You might be masking exhaustion with generosity. It’s okay to say no. Don’t lie to yourself — you already knew this wasn’t about pure kindness. It’s about control, or debt, or keeping score. The energy around this card is heavy with that “giving but watching closely” vibe.

You’re probably juggling feelings here, right? The Six of Cups reversed says you want the old warmth back, but the Nine of Cups reversed reminds you that the old dreams are broken. The Hermit reversed is your mind telling you, “Stop hiding. Face the mess.” And this card? It’s the practical fallout of that. Money, favors, emotional labor — none of it is free. Someone’s paying, someone’s receiving, and someone’s keeping tabs. 

For some of you, this might be about money or loans. For others, it’s favors or emotional support. Maybe you gave more than you should’ve. Maybe you’re waiting for a “thank you” that never comes. The clarifiers hint that you’re recovering from pain but stuck in the same spot. You’re not moving forward because the cycle hasn’t flipped yet. 

You could test the water here: if they wanted to share, they would. If they wanted to balance things out, it’d be happening already. If you keep waiting, you’re just feeding that wheel—reinforcing the pattern. So what’s your move? Boundaries. You keep your hands open, but don’t offer more than you can afford to lose. Protect your energy, your money, your peace.

Watch out for the temptation to feel guilty about it. That’s the trap. You’re not a bank. You’re not a charity. You’re a person who deserves fair exchange. That’s it. 

Yeah.

Two of Swords, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so right off the bat, this card’s energy is like you’re finally dropping the blindfold you didn’t even know you were wearing. You feel that? That moment when the “I don’t want to see” shifts into “I can’t pretend anymore.” You knew before you said it, or maybe you didn’t want to admit it to yourself, but that indecision? It’s unraveling. You’re not sitting on the fence anymore because the fence is starting to wobble under your own weight. 

But here’s the thing — this isn’t about some neat epiphany where everything lines up perfectly. No, it’s messy. It’s like when you’ve been staring at the same two choices for so long you start imagining neither is good, but the truth is, the universe’s handshake is firm and clear now: it’s time to pick a side. You can’t keep playing that “too scared to move” game with your own heart or your head. The card’s flipped, and it’s shouting, “Enough.” 

And don’t get it twisted: this isn’t about a sudden burst of confidence. It’s more like a slow-burning exhaustion from ignoring that nagging feeling in your gut that’s been screaming, “This isn’t working.” Maybe you’ve been stuck in a loop with the Six of Cups reversed—nostalgia or old comfort zones that aren’t really comfort anymore. Or maybe the Nine of Cups reversed has been whispering about unmet wishes, like you’re trying to fill a glass that’s already cracked. Now, with the Two of Swords flipped, that stuckness is cracking wide open. 

But wait — before you dive headfirst into making a decision, Spirit’s throwing the this energy reversed and this energy reversed into the mix. This isn’t the universe telling you it’s all smooth sailing from here. No, it’s more like a warning sign flashing: “Yeah, the pain might ease up, but that doesn’t mean the tides have turned just yet.” You’re stepping off the fence, but the ground beneath might still be shaky. You’re not trading one locked door for another—you’re just choosing which door to open first. 

And this whole vibe? It’s less about clarity and more about surrendering to not having all the answers. The Hermit reversed is screaming about avoiding isolation or refusing to turn inward when you really should. This suggests you might be tempted to dodge the deeper questions by rushing into a decision just to get it over with. Watch that impulse. There’s a difference between moving forward and running away from your own shadow. 

Then there’s the Six of Pentacles—balance, fairness, giving and receiving. That’s your anchor here. Don’t just choose a side blindly; make sure what you’re stepping into feels reciprocal. If one side’s asking too much without giving back, you’re just signing up for another round of imbalance. The Two of Swords reversed is the nudge to stop pretending both options are equal. Spoiler: they’re not. Your instincts are probably already leaning one way, even if your mind is scrambling to justify the other. You’re allowed to admit that. 

You feeling this? It’s a moment where you’re forced to look at your own boundaries and maybe even redraw them. You can’t keep settling for halfway solutions or pretending you’re fine with things being in limbo. That limbo’s been a mask — and you’re letting it fall. The question is, what do you do with the space that opens up after? 

Anyway.

Wait—no. This energy is not about wrapping things up neatly. You caught the vibe: there’s hesitation, a refusal to look inward the way you should. That moment when you want to retreat to your corner, but the corner’s been knocked over. That’s the reversed hermit’s jam. You’re not avoiding the silence because you love it; you’re dodging the hard questions that come with it. And you knew before you said it—there’s a block on feeling fulfilled, like the universe handed you a wish list, and then flipped the lights off on the whole thing. The satisfaction you expected? It’s sitting on the sidelines, arms crossed, looking like it’s done waiting.

This isn’t about nostalgia or sweet memories, either. That reversed energy around childhood comfort or past connections isn’t the warm hug you wanted. It’s more like an echo in a room that’s lost its furniture—there’s something missing, and it’s not coming back the way you hoped. Maybe you’re holding onto an image of how things should be, but reality’s saying, “Nope, not this time.”

And speaking of “nope,” the money or balance side of this is tricky. There’s a push and pull with give-and-take — but not the equal kind. It’s more like the scales are stuck, and someone’s been holding out, maybe even you. The clarifier here, that stubborn reversal, says the wheel’s not turning for you right now. You’re caught in a loop of the same patterns, the same disappointments, even when you try to hand things off or accept help. It’s frustrating because you want change, but change’s door is stuck.

Now, the decision-making? Yeah, that’s a mess. The energy around the two of swords reversed is like standing in front of a door with no key and no idea which way to push. You might feel like you’re choosing, but really you’re just spinning in place, overwhelmed by options or fears. You’re seeing the stakes, but the clarity? It’s hiding behind that mess of indecision and the fear of making a wrong move. And don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was coming.

Here’s the kicker: that near end, the one you think means collapse or disaster, it’s flipped. The worst is over, or maybe it didn’t even happen the way you imagined. There’s a chance to breathe without the weight crushing down. But the catch is, the wheel still won’t budge. So, you’re standing there with a broken compass, no map, and the clock ticking louder than ever.

So what’s next? It’s not about fixing everything at once or pretending you’re okay. It’s about calling someone—maybe just one person who gets it—and laying it out. A quick text, a call, a message that says, “I’m here, but barely.” Because sometimes the first crack in the wall is all you need to start something shifting.
