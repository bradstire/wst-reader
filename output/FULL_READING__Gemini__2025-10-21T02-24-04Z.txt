Hey you guys, Gemini energy rolling in hard this week. October 20 feels like it’s stirring something under the surface. You know when you’re waiting on a text but also not wanting to check your phone? Yeah, that vibe. Okay, let’s see what’s happening.

The Empress, reversed. Oh wow. This is loud. Usually, the Empress is all about growth, abundance, and feeling grounded, but flipped? It’s saying something is off with how you’re nurturing yourself—or maybe someone else isn’t pulling their weight. Mm, okay, wait. I’m seeing a situation where you’ve been giving a ton—time, energy, emotional bandwidth—and it’s not coming back. You knew this, right? That uneven give and take? It’s like planting seeds and watching nothing sprout. You’re done pretending it’s patience when really it’s just frustration.

Hold on, there’s this vibe of control slipping away here, too. Maybe you tried to manage this relationship or project, thinking you could make it bloom by sheer will. But it’s resisting. The reversed Empress doesn’t just mean neglect; it’s also about boundaries being crossed or ignored. You’re probably feeling drained, maybe even a little invisible. That’s hard when you’re the one usually holding the space for others. You see it, you feel it—like the effort is invisible or unwanted.

Wait—no. This might not be about someone else entirely. Mm-hm. It’s also pointing to you, Gemini. Are you ignoring your own needs? Skipping meals, pushing past your limits, or talking yourself out of rest? Yeah, that’s part of it. You can’t pour from an empty cup. The energy here is a warning: stop trying to fix everything and everyone until you fix you. That’s uncomfortable, but necessary. You’re not a machine. You knew this already, right?

Sheesh. The Empress reversed is also saying there’s a creative block. Maybe a side hustle, project, or even your daily routine feels stuck. You’ve been staring at the same options too long, trying to force inspiration or motivation that isn’t there. Don’t lie to yourself—you’re tired. It’s okay to step back. Stop pushing for growth when the soil itself needs rest.

Okay, so what’s the behavior here? Cut back on overextending. Say no to one thing this week—even if it feels selfish. Take a real break. Text in daylight, not midnight. Don’t answer that message right away. Protect your energy like it’s your paycheck or your last piece of pizza. You deserve that.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. There’s a temptation to blame yourself or think you’re failing because things aren’t working out. Nope. That’s not it. The reversed Empress isn’t about failure—it’s about imbalance. The scale is off, and it’s not just on you. Stop carrying this solo. Ask for help. Delegate. Outsource. Even if it’s just emotional support. You don’t have to be the rock all the time.

Alright. I’m gonna sit with that energy a sec. This card is heavy, but it’s also a wake-up call. You get it. Take this as permission to slow down and reset your boundaries. Yeah.

The Magician, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so this one’s showing up like a red flag you didn’t want to see but you knew was there. The energy feels stuck, like you’ve got all the pieces but the puzzle isn’t coming together. Maybe you’re trying to force something—plans, conversations, feelings—and it’s just not clicking. You could be overpromising or hyping yourself up, but the follow-through? Missing.

I’m seeing hesitation, or maybe even some self-doubt sneaking in. You might be second-guessing your moves, wondering if you even know what you’re doing anymore. Or worse, you could be caught up in distractions, shiny stuff that pulls you away from your real goals. That scattered focus? It usually means you’re not using your energy in a way that actually serves you.

Look, this card is waving a flag about control issues or maybe even a bit of self-sabotage. You’re juggling too many ideas or projects without finishing any. That’s why the momentum’s off. You’re not fooling anyone—especially not yourself. You knew before you said it: you’re not starting fresh; you’re repeating the same cycle and expecting a different result. Spoiler alert: it’s not gonna happen.

If you’re dealing with people, watch for manipulation or someone playing games. This energy can show up as someone who talks big but doesn’t deliver. Or maybe you’re that person—overpromising, overcommitting, then ghosting or burning out. Don’t lie to yourself. You already clocked this pattern.

Here’s the kicker: it’s time to get real about where your power actually lies. Not in hype, but in honest action. Break down the big stuff into small, manageable moves. Focus on what’s right in front of you instead of chasing every idea or distraction. You’ll know you’re on the right track when your energy feels aligned, not scattered.

Let’s keep an eye on what you’re trying to control this week. If you’re pushing too hard to make things happen, it’s probably backfiring. Step back, regroup, and tighten your focus. You don’t have to fix everything at once. One solid step beats ten shaky ones.

You feeling this? Sometimes, you gotta stop pretending you’ve got it all figured out. Admit when you’re off balance. That honesty sets you up to actually move forward. Right now, this card is a clear sign to cut the noise and zero in on what matters.

So. What are you gonna do with that energy? Keep juggling or start finishing? The choice is yours, but don’t say you weren’t warned.

Mm.

The Queen of Cups, reversed. Hm. Okay, so this one’s about emotional boundaries, but flipped. You’re not exactly rocking the calm, collected vibe right now. Instead, you might be drowning in your own feelings or pushing people away when all you really want is to be understood. Notice how this card shows up when your emotional tank is either empty or leaking all over the place. You’re probably second-guessing how much you share or hold back, but it’s messing with your day-to-day vibe more than you want to admit.

Look, you knew this was coming. The Queen of Cups reversed isn’t subtle—it’s screaming “Your feelings are a mess, and it’s bleeding into your work, your relationships, your everything.” Maybe you’ve been running on empty, trying to be the rock for everyone else, and now your own emotions are crashing hard. That jaw-tight feeling? That stomach drop? Yeah, that’s not just stress. It’s like your heart’s on overdrive, but the brakes are out. You’re either smothering yourself with too much self-care or completely ignoring your emotional needs. Neither is helping.

You might have noticed lately that you’re snapping at people, or worse, retreating to silence when someone tries to check in. That’s the reversed Queen’s trick—she makes you feel like you’re on an emotional island, but you’re not. You’re just stuck in your head, caught between wanting to open up and fearing you’ll get hurt or not heard. Don’t lie to yourself—there’s some fear there. Fear you’ll be seen as weak or too much. Guess what? That fear’s costing you energy, and it’s leaking into your daily grind. Bills, deadlines, texts from friends—you’re not fully present. You’re clocked out emotionally, even if you’re physically there.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. This card is also about emotional labor. You might be carrying more than your share at home or work. Constantly managing other people’s moods, fixing problems, smoothing over drama—it’s exhausting. And the reversed Queen says you’re at your limit. You’re done being the emotional sponge. That’s why you’re shut down or overreacting. It’s a signal that you need to set boundaries, but maybe you don’t know how or you feel guilty. That guilt? It’s another energy drain. You’ve got to stop letting it run the show.

Here’s a test for the next 24 hours: pay attention to how you respond when someone asks, “How are you?” Do you deflect? Do you overshare? Or do you freeze? Whatever your move, it’s telling you where your emotional energy is stuck. You don’t have to fix it all today, but at least clock it. Then, maybe pick one small thing you can do to protect yourself—say no to an extra favor, take a real break, text a friend who listens without judgment.

You’re not crazy for feeling this way. The reversed Queen of Cups shows up when you’re overloaded, but the good news is you can reclaim your emotional space. You just have to stop pretending you’re fine when you’re not. This isn’t forever; this is a phase that needs your attention before it spills further. So, no more ghosting yourself. Start small. Set one boundary this week, even if it feels awkward. Your emotions aren’t enemies. They’re signals. You just need to hear what they’re saying.

Okay.

The Four of Cups, reversed. Huh??

Okay, this one’s a little spicy. You’re not just sitting there bored or closed off anymore. No, you’re done with that stuck vibe. Reversed Four of Cups says you’re actually moving, even if it’s slow. You’ve been looking away, ignoring what’s been offered, yeah? But now? You’re starting to see what’s right there, staring you in the face. That’s progress. Don’t ignore that shift. You might not be ready to grab it fully, but you’re paying attention. That’s the first step.

I’m seeing two main ways this plays out for you. For some, it’s about a relationship. You got tired of feeling like you’re on the sidelines, like you’re the only one caring or showing up. You pulled back, maybe even ghosted yourself in a way—avoiding the texts, not returning calls, pretending you didn’t care. But now, you’re clocking that this silence is loud. You want to respond, but you’re scared it’s too late or that it won’t change anything. If they want in, they’ll make the move. If not, you do you. No shame in walking away, no matter what you told yourself before.

For others, this is about work or money. You might’ve been stuck in the same routine, ignoring new offers or ideas because they felt too risky or just too much effort. But you’re starting to notice new opportunities popping up, and you’re curious. Maybe it’s a different way to make money, a side hustle, or a chance to ask for a raise. It’s like you’ve been staring at the same options too long, and suddenly the universe is giving you a nudge. Don’t blow past it. Test the water before you jump in, but don’t stay frozen. Comfort versus growth—pick your side honestly.

Here’s the real kicker: you already knew this was happening. Don’t lie to yourself—you clocked the shift weeks ago or maybe even longer. The hesitation now? That’s fear pretending to be wisdom. What if you’re right to hold back? What if you’re wrong? Both are real. You can get stuck in the “what if” loop or you can act anyway. The Four of Cups reversed is screaming, “Look up. Look around. Something’s there.” You just have to decide if you want to see it or keep scrolling past.

Pause for a sec. Are you waiting for a sign? This card is it. Not a neon billboard, but a quiet tap on the shoulder. You’re not being offered a silver platter, but a chance to say yes or no with your eyes wide open. And you’re allowed to say no. You’re allowed to walk away. But don’t stay in the “no” just because it’s easier than facing the unknown.

Also, heads up: if you start feeling overwhelmed, that’s normal. Change is messy. You might want to pull back again, but that’s exactly when you test your boundaries. You’ve got tools. You’ve got people who see you. Use them. Don’t isolate just because the choice feels heavy.

Look, you’ve been carrying this tension for a while. The “should I?” “Could I?” “What if?” That stopped working. Time to lean into what’s real, not what’s comfortable. You’re not jumping off a cliff here, just stepping off the couch. That’s all.

So, what’s your move? You feeling this? Are you ready to answer the phone or open the door? Or do you need more time? That’s fine too—just don’t get stuck in indecision or numbness. You deserve better than that.

Alright, we’ll pause here. Yeah.

The Emperor, upright. Oh wow.  

Alright, here’s the deal. This card is all about control, structure, and being the one who calls the shots. You’re not just in the picture—you’re the one holding the frame, setting the rules, and yeah, making sure things don’t fall apart. No wiggle room for excuses or half-measures. You knew this before you even said it out loud. That feeling of needing to lock things down? This card is it.  

But listen, this isn’t about micromanaging life until it’s a checklist. It’s about showing up like you own your space because you do. You’ve got responsibilities, whether it’s managing money, navigating relationships, or handling that living situation that’s been dragging at your patience. The Emperor isn’t handing out sympathy medals. It’s handing out power—if you’re willing to grab it.  

I’m seeing a pattern where you might have been avoiding stepping fully into that role. Maybe it’s easier to drift than to draw boundaries. Maybe you’ve let others run the show, or you’ve been waiting for some sign to take the reins. This card says stop waiting. The reins are in your hands whether you like it or not.  

Here’s the kicker: power like this doesn’t come without pushback. You might feel like you’re being too rigid, or people are calling you bossy or controlling. So what? You’re not here to win a popularity contest. You’re here to build stability, and that means sometimes saying “no” when you want to say “yes.” You don’t have to explain yourself every time, either. Keep it simple, keep it direct.  

Also, check your energy around authority. Are you resisting because you don’t want to be responsible? Or are you stepping in half-heartedly because you’re afraid of making the wrong move? The Emperor wants you fully present, fully committed. No half measures, no second-guessing. You’re the foundation, not the loose brick.  

Look around your daily life. What needs structure? What’s been left to chance? Bills? Deadlines? That conversation you keep putting off? Get it on the calendar, get it sorted. Control isn’t about strangling your freedom—it’s about creating the space where freedom can actually happen without chaos knocking at the door.  

And hey, if this feels like too much pressure, remember: you don’t have to carry the whole world on your shoulders. Delegate where you can. But don’t abdicate. That’s the difference. You’re leading the charge, not running from it.  

I’m telling you, this card is an invitation and a challenge all at once. You’re being called to step up, hold your ground, and own your influence. Don’t lie to yourself—you know where this is headed.  

Yeah.

So here’s where this gets real. You knew before you said it—that hesitation, that little voice that said, “Maybe I’m overthinking this,” but also, “What if this is exactly the energy I need to pay attention to?” That’s the tension humming right now. It’s like you’re standing at the edge of a choice, and yet, there’s no rush. Because what’s clear is the power lies in the pause, not the leap. You can feel it, right? The pull to move, but also the pull to just breathe and hold space for the unknown.

Wait—no. Scratch that. It’s not just about waiting; it’s about how you’re showing up while you’re still figuring it out. You’re not in the dark. There’s a quiet knowing here, even if it’s wrapped in layers of “should I” and “what if.” That’s the real work—being honest with yourself about where the line blurs between hope and realism. Because in relationships or money or whatever else is tangled up in this, that’s where you’ll find the clearest signals. The ones you can’t ignore without paying a price.

And speaking of paying, this isn’t a time for throwing good energy after bad. You’ve got to be deliberate. Like, sometimes you think you’re being generous or open, but really you’re just spinning wheels. Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked that. So, what feels like a risk? What’s the move that scares you but also lights something up inside? Could be a call you’ve been avoiding. Or maybe it’s finally sending that message, or saying no to the thing that’s been draining you. You don’t have to have the whole map. You just need to take that one step where your gut feels most alive.

You feeling this? The way everything’s not neatly packaged or tied up with a bow is exactly what makes this moment so electric. It’s messy, it’s uncomfortable, and yes, it’s totally human. But also, it’s where you find your real power—when you stop pretending you have all the answers and just start trusting the process, no matter how slow or sideways it looks. This is about reclaiming control in the small moments, not waiting for some big breakthrough to drop out of nowhere.

Okay, so before we get too deep into what’s next, remember: your boundaries are your best friend right now. Whether it’s with a partner, a friend, or even yourself, be clear. Don’t let anyone else’s agenda steamroll your truth. That might mean saying yes to yourself first, even when it feels selfish. That’s not weakness; that’s survival and growth wrapped up in one.
