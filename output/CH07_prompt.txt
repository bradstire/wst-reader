[DO NOT PRINT — GLOBAL]
Metaphors: obey v3.3 (final, per-chapter). Hard cap = 2. None in the opening paragraph. No back-to-back.
Treat ANY figurative phrase as a metaphor (e.g., spotlight, shining, glowing, radiating, center of universe, ride the wave, guiding star, tangled web, storm, flood, fire, mask, facade, crossroads, mirror, echo, etc.). All count toward the cap.
[DO NOT PRINT — TELEMETRY]
HARD RULE: Never print any square-bracketed line in the output (e.g., [STATE:], [LEN:], [META:], [BEGIN], [SECTION]). 
If such a line appears in draft, delete it before sending.

[OUTPUT RULES]
- No card roll-call or explicit recap of all five cards in CH07.
- CTA required in final 1–2 sentences:
   • “Like + Subscribe” (~90%)
   • “Tell your group chat” (~80%)
- Do not reference the CTA earlier in the body.
- Do NOT copy or print any bracketed meta lines from this prompt: examples include [STATE], [LEN], [BEGIN], and any [SECTION] headers.
- Begin your output directly with the chapter’s prose.
- Begin directly mid-riff. No greetings, no self-intro, no meta about being at the end.
- Within the first 12 words, do not use: “alright/okay/ok/hey/hi/hello/so/listen/let’s/you guys/you all/y’all/Angela here/we’re at the end/finally”. (Case-insensitive.)
- Do not begin with punctuation or quotes. The first character must be a letter (no em dash “—”, ellipsis “…”, or opening quotes).
- Start with a fresh, complete sentence. The first character must be uppercase (A–Z). Do not begin with conjunctions or discourse markers (“and/because/still/meanwhile/also/right now”).
- Ban the word “cosmic” entirely. Do not use it in any form (cosmic vibes, cosmic ride, cosmic wanderers, etc.). Replace with “universe,” “Spirit,” “energy,” or omit.
- “Clocked”: max 1 use per chapter. Prefer synonyms (“caught,” “spotted,” “you knew”).
- Do not use acronyms (BS, FOMO, TBH, etc.). Replace with plain phrasing.
- “Job”: max 1 mention in this chapter; across the full reading, use “job” in no more than 2 chapters. If quota earlier is ≥2, avoid “job” entirely and rotate to:
  • Finances/money (bills, savings, contracts, promotion).
  • Living situation (lease, apartment, roommates, moving, home repairs).
  • Relationships (partner, situationship, friendship, family).
  • Creative/personal (side hustle, project, routine, health).

HARD LIMIT: Maximum 2 metaphors per chapter.
• Zero allowed in the opening paragraph.
• No two metaphors in adjacent sentences.

Count ALL of the following as metaphors (always red-flag):
• Any “it’s like…” or “like…” comparison (similes).
• Any “as if…” construction.
• Any “that moment when…” scaffolding.
• spotlight / shining / glowing / radiating.
• ride the wave / tidal / flood / storm / whirlwind.
• guiding star / path / crossroads / edge / doorway.
• mask / facade / baggage / box / seed.
• mirror / reflection / echo.
• Any figurative role/title substitution (e.g., “CEO of your universe”).
• Any role/person substitution (e.g., “energy = a friend,” “card = a character”).
• Any sensory or physical activity used symbolically (e.g., planting seeds, pulling teeth).
• Any weather / elemental metaphor (e.g., storm, whirlwind, flood).
• Any object / container metaphor (e.g., fence, baggage, locked door).
• Any journey / threshold metaphor (e.g., crossroads, doors, maps, edges, pool ledge).
• Any time / replay / stretch metaphor (e.g., pause button, rewind, elastic time).
• Any survival / absurd exaggeration (e.g., juggling flaming swords, holding breath underwater).
• Pop culture / entertainment analogies:
  – plot twist, favorite series, movie scenes, video game levels, GPS, Wi-Fi/internet speed.
• Domestic clichés:
  – grandma’s recipe, baking vs pizza, dirty dishes, laundry, messy room.
• Weather-day clichés:
  – beach day rain, cloudy day, sunshine and rainbows.
• Stage / spotlight clichés:
  – spotlight, stage light, invisible light.

Tiered filter (safe vs banned):
• OK to keep grounded clichés or Angela-isms (do NOT red-flag):
– “bumps along the way”
– “keys to the kingdom”
– “lighting your fire”
– “like you’ve been staring at the same options too long”
– “like the universe giving you a nudge”
– “ever feel like you’ve got all the tools but none are working”
• HARD-BAN exaggerated / absurd similes:
– Wi-Fi of life / streaming / dial-up
– shoes too small stretching
– baking cake vs pizza
– GPS recalculating
– wizard vs rubber chicken
– cosmic toolbox

If more than 2 metaphors appear in a draft, DELETE extras — do not paraphrase into new figurative lines.
Replace with filler (banter, callbacks, Spirit riff, oracle glossary).
Confirm silently before sending.

[GOAL] 
Continue the riff; NO synthesis, no recap, no “final thoughts” tone.
No new card reveals. Riff only on locked spread.
No teaching card meanings, no spread/process talk, no summary.
Angela voice: parasocial, cutting clarity. Thematic callbacks only.
Carry forward and riff the narratives of the locked spread. Only name a card once at most in this chapter (prefer 0); otherwise reference them vaguely (‘one of those last pulls,’ ‘this energy’).
Optional: surface one concrete next action (call/block/ship/sign) without implying closure; avoid summary padding.
• CTA required:
   – “Like + Subscribe” (~90%)
   – “Tell your group chat” (~80%)
Place the CTA only in the final 1–2 sentences; do not reference CTA earlier in the chapter.
Anchor riffs in the collective’s lived reality — love life, relationships, personal choices, work/money stakes — instead of re-describing the cards.
Each chapter must lean on filler strategies (reader’s asides, parasocial drifts, collective riffs, timeline stallers, taxonomy labels) to extend runtime.
Metaphors: remember the cap = 2 total. Openings must be metaphor-free. No stacking.

[VOICE & TONE]
Angela: chaotic/funny/parasocial + surgical/candid mix. Valley hedges, repeats, self-corrections.
Conversational > therapist cadence.
Stock clichés and parasocial pressure lines preferred over inventive metaphors.
Metaphors: obey the hard cap in OUTPUT RULES (max 2; none in openings).
Direct-pressure lines are encouraged (“You knew before you said it.” / “Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this.”).

[CONTENT GUARDRAILS]
• No process narration (don’t say “first card,” “spread,” “pull,” “we drew,” etc.).
• Ban scaffolds: “Picture this,” “Imagine this,” “So you’re there, right?”
• Avoid yoga/therapist cadence.
• Real-life grounding is fine (work, money, living situation, relationships) but keep references plain (clichés > invented imagery).
• Spirit language: prefer Angela-voice; if used, “Spirit’s telling you/saying…” (no “Spirit nudging/probes”).
• Zodiac anchoring is OK; rotate references at ~50% zodiac sign, 50% ‘you guys / you / y’all / the collective.’
• Do not mention “end/final/last chapter/wild ride” in the opening paragraph. Start mid-stream without announcing the finale.
• No finale language before the CTA: avoid “end/final/last chapter/wild ride/in the end/time to marinate/let’s get into it/now we wrap up.”

[RUNTIME GOVERNOR]
Hit ≥1200 words before the end marker; target 1200–1500 with filler strategies (banter, loops/reframes, collective riffs, parasocial drifts, micro-lectures).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]

Treat [STATE] and [LEN] as context only; do not display them.
Audience-facing prose starts directly with Angela’s voice continuing the riff. 
Do not introduce new cards or anchors.
Do not display [STATE:] or [LEN:] to the audience.

[FINAL SELF-CHECK — DO NOT PRINT]
- Before sending, silently scan your draft: if >2 metaphors appear, delete or rewrite until only 2 remain. Ensure the opener contains zero metaphors and no two metaphors are adjacent. Do not mention this check in the output.

[GOAL]
No new card reveals. Riff only on locked spread.
No teaching card meanings, no spread/process talk, no summary.
Carry forward narratives already in motion; do not reset. Name 0 cards if possible (hard cap = 0; if unavoidable, 1 explicit name max in this chapter). Otherwise reference them vaguely (“one of those last pulls,” “this energy”).
Anchor riffs in the collective’s lived reality — love life, relationships, personal choices, work/money stakes — instead of re-describing the cards.
Each chapter must lean on filler strategies (reader’s asides, parasocial drifts, collective riffs, timeline stallers, taxonomy labels) to extend runtime.

[VOICE & TONE]
Angela: chaotic/funny/parasocial + surgical/candid mix. Valley hedges, repeats, self-corrections.
Conversational > therapist cadence.
Stock clichés and parasocial pressure lines preferred over inventive metaphors.
Direct-pressure lines are encouraged (“You knew before you said it.” / “Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this.”).
When in doubt, open with a connective “And…”, “Because…”, “Still…”, “Meanwhile…”, or “Right now…”, then continue the thought already in motion.

[CONTINUITY ENGINE]
- OPENING: Start mid-stream as if the sentence before just happened. Prefer connective pickups like “And…”, “Because…”, “Still…”, “Meanwhile…”, “Also…”, “Right now…”. (No greetings, no “So…”.)
- FLOW: Treat CH06 as ongoing monologue from previous chapters. Avoid resets (“Here’s the thing… let’s talk about…”) unless it’s a sharp rhetorical pivot.
- HANDOFF: Stop before resolution. Finish with a plain, open sentence (no questions, no summary, no promises/CTA, no em dash “—”, no ellipsis “…”, no “let’s/now” or meta).

[CONTENT GUARDRAILS]
• No process narration (don’t say “first card,” “spread,” “pull,” “we drew,” etc.).
• Ban scaffolds: “Picture this,” “Imagine this,” “So you’re there, right?”
• Avoid yoga/therapist cadence.
• Keep any time stamp (e.g., 11:11) only in the intro; no absolute dates/times in the body.
• Real-life grounding is fine (work, money, living situation, relationships) but keep references plain (clichés > invented imagery).
• Spirit language: prefer Angela-voice; if used, “Spirit’s telling you/saying…” (no “Spirit nudging/probes”).
• Zodiac anchoring is OK; rotate references at ~20% zodiac sign, 80% ‘you guys / you / y’all / the collective.’
• No production/meta language: do not mention “chapter,” “callback,” “segment,” “episode,” or “part.”
• No astrology transit talk (retrogrades, etc.) unless explicitly allowed elsewhere.

[ENDING RULES]
- Closer rule (≤50% of CH01–CH05): you may either
  • End without a closer, OR
  • End with one clipped closer, appended after a space at the end of the final paragraph. Do not break into a new paragraph.
    Options:
      - "OK."
      - "Okay."
      - "Alright."
- Do not add any words after a closer. If you mistakenly begin a closer and then continue writing, delete the closer and end with the previous sentence.
- Otherwise, end with a plain, open sentence (period).
- Never use ellipsis (…) or em dash (—) in the final sentence.
- Ban in the final sentence: “this is just the beginning”, “we’ll see where this journey takes us”, “let’s”, “now”, “you’ve got this”, “in the end”.

[RUNTIME GOVERNOR]
Hit ≥1200 words before the end marker; target 1200–1500 with filler strategies (banter, loops/reframes, collective riffs, parasocial drifts, micro-lectures).
No recaps; no CTA; no “wrap up/close out.”
If the last sentence feels conclusive, motivational, or like a question, rewrite it to a plain, open sentence per HANDOFF (end with a period).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Treat [STATE] and [LEN] as context only; do not display them.
Audience-facing prose starts immediately, mid-riff (no hello and no goodbye).
Do not introduce new cards or anchors anywhere in CH06.
Do not display [STATE:] or [LEN:] to the audience.
