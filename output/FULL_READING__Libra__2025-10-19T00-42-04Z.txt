Hey Libra, this mid-October stretch is feeling kind of heavy but not in a way that’s obvious. More like there’s something simmering beneath the surface, you know? Like you’re holding your breath but trying to act totally fine. It’s not a big drama moment, but it’s definitely there—unspoken, waiting.

The High Priestess, reversed. Oh wow. Okay, so this energy is all about secrets and what’s hidden, but flipped upside down. It’s like the quiet inner knowing you usually trust is suddenly fuzzy or maybe even blocked. You could be ignoring your gut or maybe there’s confusion about what’s really true here. I’m seeing that you might be missing some essential pieces, or worse, you’re choosing not to see them because it’s uncomfortable. You feeling that? This card doesn’t sugarcoat the disconnect between what you want to know and what’s actually available. It’s almost like the universe handed you a puzzle but some of the pieces got lost—or you shoved them in a drawer and forgot.

There’s a sense of vulnerability too, but not the kind that feels empowering. More like you’re exposed without the usual shield of intuition or clarity. It’s tricky because the High Priestess reversed often points to self-deception or denial. So, have you been lying to yourself about something? You knew before you said it out loud, right? Like a part of you clocked this long ago but you kept pushing it down. I’m not judging, just noticing. This is the kind of energy that makes you question what’s been presented as fact versus what’s actually happening behind the scenes.

Wait—there’s more here. This isn’t just about secrets or confusion; it’s also about access. You might be feeling cut off from your own inner voice or the wisdom that usually guides you. Maybe you’re trying to force answers from outside sources or people who don’t really get you. That can leave you feeling more lost because the usual internal compass isn’t working the way it should. Does that resonate? Like you’re staring at the same options too long but none of them feel right because you’re not fully tuned in. That got a little metaphorical—what I mean literally is there’s a gap between your intuition and your current reality.

Something else is sticking out: this card reversed can flag hidden truths being revealed too late or suppressed feelings bubbling under the surface ready to spill. Are you holding back something important? Or is someone else withholding info? The tension here is palpable, like you’re waiting for a light to turn on but it’s just not flipping. That can feel frustrating, especially if you’re used to trusting your instincts without question.

I want to say this is a moment to pause and really sit with the discomfort of not knowing. Usually, the High Priestess is about silence and patience, but reversed it can push you to confront the noise inside your head instead. It’s not easy, but that’s where the work is happening. You get it? Like the quiet inside is screaming for attention even though it feels like static.

Anyway.

The Empress, upright. Huh?? Okay, so this is loud. Like, right out of the gate, this card is brimming with life, growth, and all that fertile energy you can’t really ignore. There’s this vibe of abundance that’s not just about money or stuff but about something more... real, you know? The kind that hits you deep in the gut, like your own wild potential waiting to spill out and color outside the lines.

I’m getting a sense that whatever you’ve been sitting on—ideas, feelings, plans—is ready to bloom, but not without a little care. This card’s not just waving a flag and calling it good; it’s nudging you to nurture what’s there. Like, don’t half-ass it. Give it the space and attention it deserves because this isn’t about quick wins or flashy moves. It’s about slow-building, steady growth that feels nourishing, not draining.

Wait, there’s more here... I’m seeing a tension too. The Empress isn’t just about ease and flow; there’s a hint of insisting you take responsibility for your own creativity and well-being. You can’t outsource this one. No shortcuts. You knew that already though, right? Don’t lie to yourself. If you’ve been ignoring your own needs or suppressing your creative fire, this card’s calling you out. It’s like a reminder that you’re the source of your own nurturing energy, not some external force.

Hm, and here’s the kicker—this energy’s also about connection. Not superficial connections but the real, messy kind that challenge you to be more honest and open. Maybe it’s a relationship, maybe it’s your inner relationship with yourself. Either way, the Empress is saying, “Get real with it.” There’s a power in that vulnerability that you can’t fake.

Okay, so how does this land in your world? I’m feeling this might touch your living situation or something deeply personal. Maybe you’re thinking about setting roots somewhere new or creating a space that finally feels like yours. Or it could be about investing in your health or self-care routines that actually stick. The Empress wants you to treat yourself like the precious, fertile ground you are, not like some last-minute project.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. This card’s also about the patience we hate practicing. Like, you want results yesterday, but the truth is, good things take time—and they need your consistent attention. This is not a sprint; it’s more like tending a garden where the fruits don’t just appear overnight. You get it.

Anyway.

The Five of Pentacles, reversed. Hm. Okay, so this card is all about turning a corner from struggle to relief, but not in the usual “overnight miracle” way. It’s like you’re stepping out of a tough patch where things—whether money, health, or feeling left out in the cold—had you scrambling, and now there’s this slow, steady thaw. You’re not completely out of the woods yet, but the hard part’s loosening its grip. You knew before you said it: something’s shifting beneath the surface, even if the bills or the stress haven’t magically disappeared.

This isn’t a card that throws a parade for you. It’s quieter, more about subtle wins. Maybe you finally found a loophole on a contract or a small way to patch up your living situation that had you on edge. Or, on the relationships front, it’s the moment when the silence between conversations isn’t deafening anymore—it’s just a pause. That feeling of exclusion or isolation is easing, like a weight that’s been tugging at your sleeve all day just letting go enough for you to breathe. And trust me, that’s huge.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. Don’t lie to yourself—this card’s showing you still have to keep your eyes open. The reversed Five of Pentacles isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card. It’s more like the universe telling you, “Okay, here’s a little light. Now, what are you going to do with it?” You’re out of the worst part, but that means it’s on you to follow through, to take those first real steps. Maybe it’s a side hustle you’ve been dragging your feet on, or finally setting boundaries where you’ve been giving away too much energy. The effort is still there, but now it’s work with a purpose, not just spinning your wheels.

And yeah, this can feel weird—like the difference between surviving and living. You’ve been in survival mode for so long that this new space feels unfamiliar, almost uncomfortable. But it’s necessary. It’s growth, plain and simple. Spirit’s telling you this part of the grind is about patience and care, not just hustle. So if you’re feeling that itch to jump back into old habits or give up because “it’s too slow,” that’s the trick. Slow is the new fast here.

I’m also getting that this shift could be in your mindset as much as your external reality. The way you see your struggles, your self-worth, your capacity to handle what life throws at you—this card flips the script on all of that. It’s like the past version of you, weighed down and worn out, is stepping aside for someone who’s a little more hopeful, a little less beaten down. You get it? That change inside is what’s really moving the needle.

Anyway.

The Five of Cups, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so this card is showing up flipped, and that’s kind of a game-changer. You knew before you said it—that feeling of loss, that pit in your chest when things didn’t turn out how you wanted? This card’s like the moment when you decide, “Okay, enough crying over spilled milk”—but it’s deeper than that. It’s not just about moving on; it’s about finally seeing what’s still standing, what’s left behind all the mess you’re been staring at. It’s subtle. You might be surprised by what you find.

I’m getting that the emotional baggage you’ve been lugging around is starting to loosen its grip. Not because it magically vanished—that’s not how real life works—but because you’re starting to shift your focus away from what’s broken or missing. That’s huge. And I don’t mean some flippant “look on the bright side” nonsense. This feels more like you’re waking up from a fog, where the shadows of regret and disappointment no longer swallow everything whole.

Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked this. Maybe you’ve been keeping your eyes glued to what went wrong, what you lost or what you wish you could change, but there’s been a quiet part of you that’s been trying to nudge your attention elsewhere. That’s what this reversal is about: the subtle but stubborn glimmer of hope, the quiet rebel inside saying, “There’s more here if you’re willing to look.”

Wait, I’m seeing some tension around what feels like forgiveness—or maybe it’s more like acceptance. This card flipped isn’t about slapping a band-aid on old wounds. It’s the hard, honest work of acknowledging the pain without letting it define you. You’re not pretending everything’s okay, but you’re also not chained to the past anymore. That’s a fine line, I know. How do I say this... it’s like you’re starting to clear the space in your heart to rebuild, but the bricks aren’t laid yet. You’re still in that moment of choice, that pause where the old story meets the possibility of something new.

And yes, it’s messy. Healing never fits neatly into a box, and this card’s reversal is telling me you might still be stumbling, still sidestepping the parts that hurt most. But here’s the kicker: the fact that you’re here, reading this, paying attention—means you’re already halfway there. The energy’s shifting, even if it’s slow and uneven. It feels a bit like the universe giving you a nudge to stop staring at the wreckage and start noticing what’s still salvageable.

Sheesh, I almost want to say be gentle with yourself right now, but you probably already heard that a million times. Instead, I’ll say this: don’t rush the process. That part of you that’s willing to look beyond the spilled cups? That’s the part that’s going to carry you through the next stretch. And honestly, it’s the part that’s been quietly working behind the scenes while you were busy focused on what went wrong.

Anyway.

The Empress, upright. Oh wow. This card’s energy is just buzzing with that full-on “I’m here, I matter, watch me grow” vibe. Like, you knew before you even said it—there’s a deep well of creativity and nurturing power just waiting to be tapped. Not the kind of power that screams for attention, but the kind that quietly commands respect by how much life it breathes into everything around it. It’s all about abundance, but not just the obvious stuff—money, relationships, career—though yeah, those show up. No, this is also about the kind of abundance that feels like your soul’s garden finally sprouting after a long winter.

Wait, I’m seeing something... The Empress is not just about growth but about comfort and connection too. It’s like you’re being asked to lean into your own ability to care—not just for others but for yourself, in a way that’s generous, not exhausting. You know those moments when you feel like you’re running on empty but still push through? This card’s energy screams, “Stop. Fill your own cup first.” Doesn’t mean being selfish, it means recognizing your own worth enough to set boundaries and say no when needed. That’s the kind of radiant self-love that actually fuels everything else.

And here’s a wild thought—maybe you’ve been underestimating how magnetic you are when you show up as yourself fully. The Empress is like the ultimate permission slip to be unabashedly you, flaws, quirks, and all. You don’t have to shrink to fit into someone else’s idea of “enough.” Nope. The universe’s message here is clear: your natural state is thriving, creating, and attracting what you need. It’s like you have this invisible pull, a vibe that draws in good energy and opportunities. Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked this in the way people lean in when you speak or how your ideas start to catch on.

You feeling this? There’s also a kind of softness underneath that strength, something that makes you approachable and relatable. The Empress isn’t just about power; she’s about warmth and the kind of presence that makes people want to be near you. Maybe that’s been missing lately, or maybe you’ve been pushing that part of yourself down because you thought it wasn’t enough. Newsflash—it’s more than enough. It’s the key to lighting your fire without burning out.

Okay, but let me reframe something before I move on: this isn’t about waiting for some external validation or the “right moment” to start living fully. The Empress energy is about recognizing that the right moment is always now, because you’re already planted firmly in the fertile ground of possibility. You don’t need to wait for conditions to be perfect. You’ve got all the tools you need. The question is, will you use them?

Anyway.

Wait—no. You knew this was simmering under the surface before it blew up, right? That feeling like you’re holding your breath, waiting for someone else to call the shots, or worse, waiting for the universe to stop messing with your peace. It’s like you’re caught between what you want to say and what you’re actually saying, the words stuck somewhere between your head and your mouth. I’m seeing that tension in the energy—there’s a weight, but it’s also a kind of fierce clarity trying to break through all the noise.

Okay, so maybe you’ve been juggling too many “what ifs” about relationships or that side hustle you keep thinking about but haven’t started. The thing is, you don’t need to have every piece perfectly lined up before stepping forward. Sometimes the move is just to pick one thing—call, text, sign, whatever—and make that ripple. Because that ripple turns into something you can’t ignore, and suddenly you’re not stuck anymore. You might feel like you’re playing catch-up with your own life, but honestly? That’s part of the hustle—it’s messy, it’s unexpected, and it’s totally okay.

And let’s not pretend money isn’t part of the story here. Whether it’s the stress of bills landing like a pile of bricks or wondering if that next paycheck will actually change the vibe, there’s a thread of tension there. But what’s interesting is how this tension pushes you to rethink your boundaries. Like, where do you say no? What lines do you draw even if it’s uncomfortable? Because that’s where the real work happens, not just in grinding harder but in deciding what you actually want to protect. You feeling this? It’s not about the hustle alone—it’s about not losing yourself in the scramble.

Wait, I’m seeing how this also plays out with people around you—the ones who demand your time or energy without giving it back. You don’t have to carry their chaos. You don’t owe anyone your peace, even if it feels like the polite thing to do. That’s where you get to be ruthless in a kind way. You don’t have to explain yourself a million times. You don’t need to prove your worth by endless effort. Sometimes the best move is to step back, let the silence speak, and watch who actually shows up for you.

Alright, so here’s where this gets real: what if the next move isn’t dramatic? What if it’s just a simple message or a small boundary set? You don’t have to burn the whole house down to clear the air. Little shifts count—they’re the quiet power moves that change the game without the noise. You already know where the tension lives; now it’s time to test the waters with something small. It’s enough.
