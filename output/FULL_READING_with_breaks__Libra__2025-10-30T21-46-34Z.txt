Hey Libra! <break time="2.2s" /> October’s wrapping up, and I’m seeing a vibe where you’re feeling the weight drop off—or at least shifting somehow. <break time="2.3s" /> Something that had you bent over backwards might be loosening its grip. <break time="5.3s" /> You’re noticing that, right? <break time="6.2s" /> Like, things you’ve been carrying, maybe longer than you should, are suddenly less... <break time="3s" /> urgent. <break time="2.1s" /> Or maybe you’re just done pretending they are. <break time="3.8s" />

Ten of Wands, reversed. Oh wow. <break time="1.1s" /> This card’s shouting one thing loud and clear: you’re letting go of a huge load. <break time="9.3s" /> Not just deciding to drop it, but finally actually doing it. <break time="6.7s" /> You knew this was coming, didn’t you? <break time="2.5s" /> You’ve been dragging so much stress, responsibilities, or emotional baggage that it’s been crushing your vibe. <break time="10.1s" /> And now, you’re done. <break time="2.9s" /> Maybe you stopped trying to fix everything on your own, or maybe you just gave up on trying to carry all that weight alone. <break time="5s" /> Either way, the energy here is about relief—but it’s not magic. <break time="8.9s" /> It’s slow. <break time="7s" /> It’s messy. It’s that moment when you realize the pile in your hands is too much and you just... <break time="3.4s" /> set it down. Whether that’s at work, with family, or in a relationship—it’s happening.

I’m seeing there’s some frustration under this. You could have been burned out for a while, feeling like you’re the only one putting in the effort. <break time="7.6s" /> That supporting energy underneath is showing teamwork problems, or maybe you felt unappreciated. <break time="2.6s" /> Like you were building something with others, but they weren’t pulling their weight. <break time="2.2s" /> That’s this energy, creeping in quietly here. You probably had to carry the plan, the vision, or the daily grind alone, and that’s what led to this snap where you just can’t do it anymore. <break time="4.4s" /> You tried to get help and it didn’t come, or you asked for support and got radio silence. <break time="1.9s" /> So now, you’re stepping back.

There’s also this sense of leaving behind a tough situation—mentally or physically. <break time="1.8s" /> this energy shows up as a quiet undercurrent to this card’s energy. <break time="2.9s" /> It suggests you’re moving away from a place that’s been draining you, maybe even a mindset that kept you stuck. <break time="6.8s" /> Not necessarily a dramatic exit, but a slow, steady shift. <break time="3.8s" /> You might still be dealing with the fallout of what you dropped, but you’re in transit. <break time="3.4s" /> You’re not where you were, and you’re not quite where you want to be yet, but you’re moving.

You might have noticed you’re not as reactive anymore. <break time="3.6s" /> You’re less likely to pick up extra shifts, say yes to every favor, or answer every call that pulls you into drama. <break time="1.2s" /> You’re setting boundaries without a lot of fanfare. <break time="3.2s" /> That’s huge, especially if you used to carry everyone else’s burden like it was your job. <break time="2.2s" /> This is the energy of taking back your space. And honestly, you’ve earned it. <break time="7s" /> You might be surprised at how good it feels to finally admit you can’t do it all—and then act on it.

But, and this is important, don’t rush this. Dropping the load doesn’t mean you’re fixed overnight. <break time="1.5s" /> You might still feel the strain, the old habits pulling you back in. <break time="1.7s" /> That’s normal. <break time="3.5s" /> The key is you’re aware now. <break time="2.2s" /> You’re not pretending to be fine or pushing through exhaustion. <break time="2.8s" /> You’re choosing what to keep and what to let go. That’s work, even if it looks like a break.

Yeah. <break time="3.2s" /> This is a pivot point. <break time="2.9s" /> You’re shifting from overwhelmed to intentional. <break time="6.5s" /> You’re not carrying what’s not yours anymore. This is about survival, but more than that, it’s about reclaiming your energy. <break time="1.1s" /> You knew this already, right? <break time="4.8s" /> You saw it coming every time you felt tired, over it, or like you just wanted to scream. <break time="3.1s" /> Now, you’re acting on it.

Hold on. <break time="3.6s" /> There’s more showing up here. But for now, let me sit with this energy a second. <break time="1.8s" /> Yeah, okay. <break time="3.1s" />

Six of Cups. Oh wow.

Alright, so this card just popped up right after the Ten of Wands, reversed — that weight dropping off your shoulders, but not without a little resistance. <break time="2.5s" /> The Six of Cups is pulling you back to old times, memories, maybe even people from the past. <break time="2.1s" /> But here’s the twist: it’s not about daydreaming or getting stuck in nostalgia. <break time="2.7s" /> No, this energy is asking you to look at what’s behind those memories and how they’re showing up now.

You might be dealing with someone who feels familiar, or a situation that repeats like a skipped record. <break time="2.8s" /> this energy, lurking underneath, says teamwork or collaboration is off. <break time="2.7s" /> That’s where the tension lies. Maybe you or the other person are not showing up fully, or the effort isn’t equal. <break time="7.9s" /> You’re caught between wanting to return to something comfortable and realizing the foundation isn’t solid.

this energy under the surface adds another layer. It’s about moving on, heading toward calmer waters. <break time="2.9s" /> But it’s not an easy ride — the transition feels heavy, even if you’re trying to escape the chaos. <break time="2.6s" /> You haven’t fully left that old place behind. <break time="2.3s" /> You’re navigating the space between what used to be and what could be, and that middle ground is uncomfortable. <break time="3.4s" /> You knew this already; you just didn’t want to admit it.

Look, the past isn’t just a happy place with warm smiles. <break time="3.3s" /> It’s also where you learned patterns, sometimes toxic ones. <break time="3.8s" /> This card asks you: are you really ready to revisit that, or are you romanticizing it to avoid the hard work of moving forward? <break time="2.1s" /> The reversed this energy says the collaboration isn’t working because someone’s holding back, maybe you. <break time="2.3s" /> Maybe they are. You’re not building anything new here; you’re trying to patch up what’s already broken.

this energy is whispering, “You gotta leave something behind.” But there’s hesitation. <break time="2.1s" /> You’re stuck in that liminal space. You’re not fully stepping into the new, nor are you completely in the old. <break time="1.5s" /> That’s exhausting. <break time="2.8s" /> The energy underneath is one of transition, but it’s messy.

If you’re waiting for someone from the past to change or come back different, watch what they do, not what they say. <break time="2s" /> The reversed this energy is a red flag for uneven effort. <break time="1.7s" /> You’re not the only one with history here — they have their own baggage too. <break time="7.4s" /> You knew this before you said it out loud. <break time="3s" /> Don’t lie to yourself.

There’s a choice to be made: stay comfortable in a flawed partnership or situation, or push through the discomfort of real change. <break time="2.5s" /> The Six of Cups isn’t about forgetting the past but about learning the lesson and not repeating the same mistakes. <break time="1.4s" /> The presence of this energy suggests you’re trying to move on, but the reversed this energy reminds us that growth doesn’t happen alone. <break time="4.5s" /> If collaboration keeps failing, maybe the partnership is done.

You might feel pulled between the familiarity of what’s behind and the uncertainty ahead. <break time="2.8s" /> That’s normal. <break time="2.3s" /> But the weight of the past can’t keep hanging over you like it did with the Ten of Wands, reversed. <break time="1.5s" /> You dropped the burden, but you haven’t dropped the history yet.

So, what’s the next move? Watch for uneven energy from others. If they don’t meet you halfway, it’s on them. <break time="2.8s" /> You’re neither the fixer nor the caretaker here. You’re done playing that role. You’re halfway out already, even if you don’t realize it.

Mm. <break time="4.4s" />

The Hermit. Hmm.

Okay, so here’s what’s happening. <break time="2.3s" /> You’re holding way too much already—like that Ten of Wands, reversed, screaming "drop the weight," but you haven’t. <break time="7.2s" /> You’re stuck in this mental loop where you want to walk away from the chaos, but you’re still tangled in it. <break time="2.9s" /> Then the Six of Cups shows up, pulling you back into old memories, nostalgia, maybe someone from your past or just a time when things felt simpler. <break time="2.7s" /> But the Hermit? <break time="10s" /> This card isn’t about reaching back. <break time="2.6s" /> It’s about stepping back—solo, no distractions, no crowds—just you and your own headspace.

You knew before you said it: people around you aren’t on the same page. <break time="5.9s" /> this energy reversed underneath this is a red flag. <break time="6.9s" /> Collaboration? Nah, it’s more like people not showing up or doing their part. <break time="2.7s" /> Maybe you’ve been trying to patch things up at work, or in a friendship, or even family. <break time="3.7s" /> You’re putting in effort, but the energy’s not reciprocated. <break time="9.6s" /> It’s draining. <break time="2.2s" /> So the Hermit says, “Enough.” That’s the official “I’m going inward” card—the kind where you stop chasing external approval or fixing what’s broken for others.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. <break time="2.5s" /> this energy lurking beneath this mass is interesting. <break time="1.9s" /> It’s the energy of moving on, leaving heavy stuff behind, traveling toward calmer waters—but it’s not a sprint. <break time="10.3s" /> It’s a slow, deliberate shift. So maybe you’re not quite ready to throw in the towel on everything just yet. <break time="2.8s" /> You’re still figuring out the exit route. <break time="2.9s" /> The Hermit’s presence is telling you to slow down, get clear. <break time="2.2s" /> Not to run away from your responsibilities, but to sort through the brain fog and emotional clutter that’s been weighing you down.

You’re probably exhausted, right? <break time="2.6s" /> Like that reversed Ten of Wands—it’s showing you’ve been carrying more than your share. <break time="3.8s" /> Maybe you’ve been juggling work shifts, bills, relationship drama, or family obligations that keep piling up. <break time="2.6s" /> And whatever this is, you’re done pretending it doesn’t affect you. <break time="2.7s" /> The jaw might be tight, the stomach dropping, but you’re looking for a way out that doesn’t involve burning bridges or yelling at everyone.

The Hermit’s not about isolation as punishment. It’s about recalibrating. You’re pulling back, dialing down the noise, so you can hear what you really want. <break time="7.9s" /> And don’t lie to yourself—you’re scared of what you might find when you do. <break time="3s" /> But that’s the point. It’s time to get honest. <break time="2.9s" /> This card almost dares you: “Are you ready to face yourself without distractions?”

It’s wild how the Six of Cups is still here, though, whispering about the past. <break time="2.7s" /> Maybe you’re tempted to revisit old comforts, old people, old habits. <break time="3s" /> But the Hermit is putting a pause on that. This isn’t a rewind moment. It’s a deep breath before you move on. What’s feeding this energy is a sense of being unrecognized or unsupported, like you’re stuck doing all the heavy lifting alone. <break time="2.7s" /> You start to see that maybe the reasons you’ve been holding on are more about comfort than growth.

In the next 7 days, test this out. <break time="2s" /> Take one small action toward solitude—not ghosting, but carving out quiet space. <break time="4.1s" /> Turn off the phone for an hour, cancel a social event, or just sit with your thoughts and write down what feels real. <break time="3.4s" /> It’ll be uncomfortable at first. <break time="3.3s" /> That’s okay. <break time="6.3s" /> This isn’t forever; it’s a phase where you get to ask, “What’s mine, and what’s not?”

You get it. <break time="4s" />

Page of Swords. Huh?? Okay, so here we go. <break time="2.8s" /> This card is all about sharp observation and sudden clarity, but it’s not the “let’s be nice” version. <break time="4.3s" /> Nope. This is the “call-it-out, no filter” type—think of it as the one who shows up unannounced, blindsides you with the truth, and leaves you scrambling to catch up. <break time="7.1s" /> You knew this was coming, right? <break time="2.2s" /> Like that text you didn’t want to see but opened anyway.

Look, the Ten of Wands reversed is hanging out in the background, showing you’re trying to drop the weight, but the Page of Swords says—hold up—you’re not quite clear on what you’re unloading or why. <break time="6.8s" /> You might have thought, “I’m done, I’m free,” but this card says there’s still a mess to untangle. <break time="5.9s" /> Maybe you dropped the wrong stuff? <break time="2.3s" /> Or maybe you’re avoiding the hard call because it’s easier to hop on the nostalgia train with the Six of Cups. <break time="3.2s" /> Yeah, that feels good—memories, old friends, the “what if” moments. <break time="6.1s" /> But this energy? <break time="4.4s" /> It’s telling you, stop living in the past or you’ll keep circling back to the same issues.

And here’s the kicker—The Hermit is right there, ready to sit you down and force some solo truth time. <break time="2.4s" /> But the Page of Swords doesn’t want that slow, quiet vibe. <break time="1.9s" /> No, this card is restless, impatient, scanning for secrets, and ready to spill the tea before you’ve even finished your coffee. <break time="2.2s" /> You feel that itch to know what’s really going on beneath the surface. <break time="2.8s" /> this energy reversed lurking below means teamwork is off balance—or maybe the collaboration you hoped for is crumbling because someone isn’t pulling their weight. <break time="2.8s" /> That’s feeding this Page’s sharp edge. <break time="2.4s" /> It’s like you’re trying to build something, but the foundation’s shaky, and this card is poking at the cracks.

Then, you’ve got this energy quietly carrying the idea of moving forward, but not without a sting. <break time="3s" /> The Page of Swords says, “Wait, wait—what’s the real story here?” You’re caught between wanting to escape the struggle and needing to face the facts. <break time="2.5s" /> This card brings that tension to a head. It’s the voice inside that’s suspicious of easy exits. <break time="3.1s" /> Like, if you walk away now, what are you leaving behind that’ll catch up to you later?

You might be dealing with someone who’s being sneaky—or maybe you’re the one holding back info, trying to protect yourself. <break time="2.2s" /> Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this. <break time="2.3s" /> The Page of Swords doesn’t do well with secrets or half-truths. <break time="2.7s" /> It demands full transparency, even if that means shaking up your comfort zone. <break time="2.9s" /> If you keep dodging, this card will keep popping up, poking holes, forcing you to face what’s really happening.

So, what’s the move? <break time="2.5s" /> Pay attention to the chatter in your head. Notice when you’re spinning a story that’s more convenient than true. <break time="2.2s" /> This isn’t the time for wishful thinking or nostalgia. <break time="2.9s" /> The Six of Cups might tempt you to rewind, but the Page says—look forward, but look sharp. <break time="3s" /> Yes, The Hermit’s asking for quiet reflection, but don’t get stuck in your head. <break time="6s" /> Use that energy to spot what’s real, not what you want to see.

If you’re trying to rebuild something with others, the reversed this energy says, check who’s actually contributing. <break time="2.9s" /> Don’t carry all the weight alone like the Ten of Wands reversed suggests you want to. <break time="2.2s" /> This card’s poking you to speak up, ask questions, and demand clarity. <break time="2.3s" /> The Page of Swords is restless for answers and doesn’t have time for games.

You’re at a point where the truth isn’t optional anymore. <break time="9s" /> It’s either you find it, lay it out, or keep spinning in circles. <break time="2.6s" /> this energy wants you moving, but the Page warns: don’t move blind. <break time="3.7s" /> Eyes wide open, questions ready.

Yeah. <break time="3.9s" />

Judgement, reversed. Huh?? Okay, so right off the bat, this one’s throwing shade on the whole “wake-up call” vibe. <break time="9.9s" /> Like, you knew deep down something needed to change, but here we are—still stuck, not quite ready to answer the call or maybe just ignoring the damn alarm clock altogether. <break time="2.4s" /> It’s that moment when your inner voice is yelling, but you keep hitting snooze, and it’s getting louder, but you’re pretending it’s background noise.

I’m seeing a strong resistance here—maybe even denial. <break time="2.7s" /> Like, you’re carrying the weight of decisions you haven’t fully owned yet, or you’re sidestepping the reckoning that’s overdue. <break time="2.3s" /> The Ten of Wands reversed is teasing that exhaustion, like you’re dropping some of those burdens, but not because you’ve made peace with them. <break time="4.1s" /> More like you’re forced to because you can’t carry it anymore. <break time="2.2s" /> But dropping the load doesn’t mean you’re clear or unblocked; it just means the pressure’s shifting, and the real work hasn’t started.

The Six of Cups in the spread reminds me of nostalgia, but with Judgement reversed, it’s more like you’re stuck in the past, replaying old scenes because it’s safer than facing what’s next. <break time="2.4s" /> Don’t lie to yourself—have you caught yourself daydreaming about better “then” instead of stepping into better “now”? That’s the echo I’m getting. <break time="2.1s" /> You might be longing for simpler times or old versions of yourself before the complications piled on, but that longing is a double-edged sword. <break time="2s" /> It’s comforting, sure, but it also keeps you from moving forward.

And the supporting energies? this energy reversed plus this energy. Oh, this spells out the struggle loud and clear. The reversed this energy is showing a breakdown in teamwork or support. <break time="3s" /> Maybe you’re feeling isolated, like you’re doing this alone or people around you aren’t pulling their weight. <break time="2.2s" /> You’re stuck in this limbo—wanting to move forward but the foundation feels shaky. <break time="3s" /> this energy is the promise of transition, but it’s a slow, uneasy crossing. <break time="3.9s" /> You’re trying to leave something behind, but it’s not quite clean or fully done.

The Hermit pops up here, too, which is interesting. <break time="2.6s" /> It’s like you’re in this solo mental space, trying to figure it out internally, but without Judgement upright pushing for clarity, that inner search is going in circles. <break time="2.9s" /> The Page of Swords adds the sharp edge of curiosity, but maybe also impatience or defensiveness. <break time="2.9s" /> You’re watching, analyzing, but it’s not quite cutting through the fog yet.

I’m telling you, this spread is brimming with that tension between wanting to evolve and staying stuck. <break time="2.7s" /> You can feel the pull—your soul wants to shed old skins, but the fear or uncertainty or plain old stubbornness is holding you back. <break time="2.9s" /> Judgement reversed is the gatekeeper who’s still waiting for you to step up and truly accept what needs to change.

And yeah, I get it. Facing the music is scary. <break time="2.4s" /> It’s like standing in front of a mirror and not liking the reflection, but also not willing to change the angle or the light. <break time="1.2s" /> But this pause? It’s not forever. The universe’s nudge is there, even if you’re turning your back right now.

You feeling this? <break time="2.2s" /> Don’t rush it, but don’t stall either. <break time="2.9s" /> That moment when you stop pretending and start owning is closer than you think. <break time="3.3s" /> Anyway.

Okay, so here’s the thing: you’ve been carrying more than your fair share, and it’s not just physical weight or responsibilities. <break time="4.5s" /> This is that heavy vibe that sticks in your chest when you try to speak up but something keeps holding you back. <break time="4.6s" /> You caught this before you even said a word, didn’t you? <break time="2.7s" /> That nagging feeling that the team’s not on the same page or you’re out here building alone. <break time="5.6s" /> The reversed energy around collaboration is flashing a warning sign—either you’re not getting the support you need, or you’re not showing up the way you want to. <break time="4.1s" /> Either way, it’s creating a weird disconnect that’s messing with your momentum.

And, okay, nostalgia’s playing a sneaky role too. <break time="1.5s" /> That longing for simpler times, maybe a relationship or friendship that felt less complicated or a moment you wish you could rewind to. <break time="3.4s" /> But here’s what’s tricky: dwelling there won’t help you cross the river to calmer waters. <break time="5.1s" /> The cards are clear—there’s a transition moment happening, a move toward something new, but your focus is half-turned backward. <break time="4.1s" /> You’re caught between wanting to revisit the past and needing to step into your own light with more independence.

Speaking of stepping into the light, the inner work has been relentless. <break time="2.8s" /> You’ve been retreating to that quiet place inside, trying to figure out what’s your truth versus what’s everyone else’s noise. <break time="2.6s" /> But watch out—sometimes that hermit energy can turn into a trap, isolating you just when you need a fresh perspective or a fresh set of eyes. <break time="1.6s" /> And with all this mental energy buzzing, you might be overanalyzing every little thing, spinning your wheels instead of moving forward.

Here’s a kicker: judgment—yeah, that big call you’re waiting for or maybe resisting—feels stuck. <break time="2.1s" /> Something’s holding you back from making that final leap, and it’s not just fear. <break time="5.4s" /> It’s like you’re second-guessing your own call to action, maybe doubting your readiness or the clarity of your decision. <break time="5.3s" /> Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was coming. <break time="3.1s" /> That hesitation is part of the process, but don’t let it turn into a freeze.

So, what’s the move? Maybe it’s time to cut the noise—clear the mental fog and stop trying to carry everything alone. <break time="3.3s" /> Reach out, ask for help even if it feels vulnerable, and let the people who care show up for you. <break time="7s" /> That old familiar comfort isn’t where the answer lives anymore. <break time="1.8s" /> You need to trust that the shift you’re heading toward is worth the awkward, uncertain steps.

You feeling this? <break time="2.7s" /> It’s like you’ve been staring at the same options too long, waiting for a sign that you’re not alone in this. <break time="4.2s" /> Spoiler: you’re not. <break time="2.3s" /> The universe is telling you to start moving, even if it’s just one small action—a call, a message, a yes to a coffee invite. <break time="1.2s" /> That’s how the stuck moment breaks.

Okay... <break time="10s" /> that’s all I’ve got for now! If this hit!... <break time="5.9s" /> You already know what to do! Please like, subscribe, tell your group chat! I’ll see y’all soon.
