Hey Gemini, I see you showing up on October 18 with your trademark curiosity, juggling a bunch of thoughts and questions all at once. October can feel like a pivot point where things that were hidden or unclear start nudging you for attention. Let’s talk about what’s pressing right now.

The High Priestess, reversed. Oh wow. Okay, this card is almost shouting about secrets, confusion, and things you’re keeping locked away — maybe even from yourself. It’s like you’re sitting on a puzzle but the pieces keep slipping through your fingers. You knew something was off, right? That gut feeling you tried to ignore? The High Priestess reversed calls out that fuzzy line between intuition and doubt. It’s not that you don’t have answers; it’s that you might be refusing to trust what you already know deep down. 

This card often shows up when you’re swimming in half-truths or misinformation, and the urge is strong to dig beneath the surface. But the reversal warns against rushing headfirst into uncovering all the secrets. Sometimes the timing just isn’t right, and pushing too hard only scrambles your clarity more. It’s like the universe is telling you to pause and sort through the noise before you make a move. You might be feeling a bit off balance, like your inner compass is spinning instead of pointing north. Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this when you caught yourself second-guessing your instincts in recent situations.

On the relationship front, this card suggests there’s something you haven’t fully spoken out loud—maybe you’re holding back because you’re not sure how it will land or if you even want to face the consequences. That silence is loud. And in terms of your work or money, there’s a chance you’re hiding some doubts or fears about what’s really happening behind the scenes—contracts, negotiations, or even your own confidence. You might be waiting for clearer signs or more info before committing to the next step.

The High Priestess reversed also warns against overthinking to the point of paralysis. Ever feel like you’ve got all the tools but none are working? That mental gridlock where every option seems tangled? The key now is to step back a bit instead of pushing harder. Trust yourself enough to sit with the uncertainty and let the fog clear naturally. It’s like holding your breath underwater and finally deciding to come up for air—you need that moment of reprieve to reset.

This card’s energy is tricky because it’s about hidden knowledge but also about the danger of ignoring your inner voice. If you’re feeling disconnected from your intuition, that’s exactly what you’re being asked to address, without forcing answers. The tension between what you want to know and what you’re ready to handle might feel uncomfortable, but it’s necessary for the bigger picture.

So, yeah, if you’re tangled up in your own thoughts or feeling like something’s missing, that’s no accident. You’re being invited to spend some time in quiet reflection rather than action. Don’t rush to fill in the blanks with assumptions or gossip. Sometimes the truth shows up clearer after you give it space.

Okay.

The Hanged Man, reversed. Oh wow.

Here’s the thing: you already knew before you said it. That feeling of being stuck, spinning your wheels, like you’re supposed to be seeing things from a new angle but somehow you’re just… not. The Hanged Man flipped upside down is not about surrender or pause anymore. It’s about resistance, stubbornness, and maybe even a little bit of self-sabotage. You’re caught in a loop of your own making, and it’s exhausting. The energy around you is tense, as if you’re holding your breath waiting for a breakthrough that keeps dodging you.

You might be wrestling with a decision or a change that’s overdue. Spirit’s telling you that the usual methods aren’t cutting it, but you’re stuck in old patterns anyway. Maybe it’s about your relationships, where you’re trying to force an outcome without doing the internal work. Or finances, where you keep pushing the same strategy even though the results are lukewarm at best. This card flipped says: stop pretending the problem doesn’t exist just because it’s uncomfortable.

Don’t lie to yourself — you clocked it when the old approach stopped working and yet you kept pushing the same buttons. This is a call to break the cycle, not by brute force, but by shifting your perspective in a way that feels honest and freeing. The resistance you’re feeling? It’s a signpost, not a dead end. You don’t need to make a huge leap here. Small changes in mindset or routine can crack open new possibilities.

Now, this isn’t a free pass to stay stuck either. The reversed Hanged Man can sometimes mean you’re delaying action because of fear or pride. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment or the “right” conditions, you’re just spinning. The universe isn’t going to hand you clarity on a silver platter. You have to lean in, even if it’s uncomfortable.

If you’re feeling the weight of indecision, it’s okay. That’s the point — this card acknowledges the struggle but also demands you stop pretending that time alone will solve it. It’s time to untangle yourself from the paralysis and own the discomfort. The truth you’re avoiding is exactly what will set you free.

Keep your eyes on where you’ve been resisting — the places you’ve been holding back your own power. That’s where the shift starts. You don’t have to figure it all out in one go. Just don’t keep pretending you’re okay with standing still. The energy is waiting for you to move, not freeze.

Okay.

The Magician, reversed. Huh??

You knew it wasn’t going to be as smooth as the highlight reel you tell your friends about. The Magician flipped upside down? That’s the universe clocking you on some serious energy misfire. It’s like having all the ingredients for success laid out in front of you but somehow ending up with a half-baked cake. You’ve got the tools, the ideas, the drive—but the execution? MIA. Don’t lie to yourself — you already spotted the disconnect between what you want to manifest and the actual moves you’ve made.

Maybe you’ve been trying to juggle too many creative projects or side hustles at once. Or perhaps you’re stuck in that limbo where you feel like you should be doing something big, but the spark just isn’t catching fire. The Magician reversed says, “Hold up — check your foundation.” It’s a call to stop acting like you’re the master of the universe when your focus is all over the place. The energy is scattered, and it’s sabotaging your potential.

If you’ve been ignoring the details, now’s the time to tune in. This card isn’t about giving up; it’s about recalibrating. You’re not missing the key to the kingdom — you just haven’t turned it right yet. Look at where your effort has been leaking out. Maybe you’re talking a big game but not backing it up with consistent action. Or maybe you’re so used to winging it that you skipped the planning phase altogether. The Magician reversed says this is your wake-up call to get real with what you’re capable of and what you actually commit to.

On the money front, this could point to some shaky ground. Are you spreading your finances too thin, or making impulsive decisions that don’t align with your bigger goals? It’s time to slow down and build a stable base before the next big leap. This card is a reminder that magic isn’t just about flash—it’s about steady, thoughtful willpower.

Relationships can feel off too. Maybe you’ve been trying to play all sides or wear too many masks, and it’s creating confusion or mistrust. The Magician reversed wants you to be authentic, even if it means admitting you don’t have all the answers. Being honest about your limits can actually build more trust than pretending you’re the CEO of your circle.

You’re in a phase where your routine might feel forced or out of sync. It’s okay to admit that your current rhythm isn’t working. The Magician reversed is like a nudge to stop pretending you’re juggling flaming swords perfectly and instead get back to basics. What part of your daily effort is just going through the motions? What needs tweaking so you can stop wasting energy and start creating real momentum?

This isn’t a failure. It’s a course correction. You’ve got the power; you just have to align your focus and energy with your true intentions. No more shortcuts or smoke and mirrors. It’s time to show up, clear the clutter, and get down to the real work. OK.

The Devil, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so this one shows up flipped, which means the usual chains and shadows are loosening up a bit. That’s a relief, but don’t start thinking you’re off the hook just yet. The Devil reversed is like the moment you realize the thing holding you back isn’t actually a prison—it’s the idea of the prison you’ve been carrying around. You knew before you said it: some part of you has been tangled up in patterns that no longer serve you, but you’ve been too stubborn or scared to pull the plug.

This card calls out the ways you’ve been stuck in sticky habits or toxic attachments, but now there’s a crack in the foundation. Maybe it’s a bad relationship you’ve been clinging to because “what else?” or an unhealthy routine you keep just because it’s familiar. It could be anything from self-doubt that whispers you’re “not enough” to financial decisions that have felt like invisible shackles on your peace of mind. The reversed Devil says, “Hey, you’re not powerless here.” Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked this.

There’s a sense of waking up, of peeling back the layers of a facade you’ve been maintaining, whether consciously or not. But beware: breaking free is rarely a clean, neat process. It’s messy, awkward, and often accompanied by guilt or fear of what’s next. You might still feel the pull of old chains, but the grip is weakening. It’s like you’ve been staring at the same options too long and suddenly the door you thought was locked swings open. This card challenges you to step through it.

Spirit’s telling you that the power to change your story has been inside you all along. The Devil reversed isn’t about judgment or punishment—it’s about liberation, but not without honesty. What are you still refusing to admit? What’s the story you keep telling yourself so you don’t have to face the truth? Because here’s the deal: the moment you face that truth, the less control those old patterns have over you.

Also, watch your boundaries. Sometimes when we start to break free, we confuse freedom with recklessness or rebellion. This card asks for a careful kind of courage, not just breaking chains but choosing what you want to wear instead. The energy here is raw and real—this is about reclaiming yourself from the places you’ve given away your power, whether it’s people, habits, or fears.

You’re not just being liberated; you’re being invited to rebuild with better bricks. It’s not about perfection—more like recognizing your own strength and deciding you don’t have to settle for less than you deserve. The Devil reversed is the wake-up call to stop dancing with the familiar shadows and start walking towards what feels honest and true.

It’s a moment where you can’t fake it anymore. You know the old stories, the old lies. This card says it’s time to cut through the noise and start lighting your fire on your own terms. No more masks, no more facades. You’re ready to look at what’s real, messy, and all yours.

Okay.

The Star, reversed. Huh??

Alright, let’s cut to the chase. This is not the radiant, uplifting Star card you might’ve been hoping for, waving you forward like some beacon of hope. Nope. This one’s off-kilter, like a lightbulb that’s flickering or a song stuck on repeat but skipping the catchy part. If you were expecting a clear, shiny path, you’re getting something more like a hazy streetlamp. Not quite enough light to see the whole picture, but just enough to remind you that you’re still in the dark.

Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this. Maybe it’s that feeling like you’re spinning your wheels, or all that “manifesting” energy that’s been more like screaming into the void. It’s frustrating, I know. The Star reversed is basically your inner GPS recalculating because the coordinates you typed in aren’t quite right. So you’re stuck between wanting to believe things will get better and knowing, somewhere deep down, that something’s off. Like you’re waiting for a sign, but all you’re getting is static.

This card is a reality check on your hopes and dreams. It asks: are you holding on to illusions or outdated ideas about what’s possible? The Star upright is about faith and renewal, but flipped, it’s more about doubt and disillusionment. You might be craving a breakthrough, but right now, you’re tangled in uncertainty. It’s the universe telling you to be cautious about putting your energy into something that’s not fully formed or grounded. It’s not the time to blindly trust that things will magically fall into place.

Look, everybody’s been there — that stretch when you feel like you’re just pretending to believe in yourself because the alternative is too bleak. But the thing about this reversed Star is it’s not permanent. It’s a pause, a moment to reassess whether your dreams need tweaking or if you’re chasing shadows. Sometimes, what looks like a setback is just a reminder to get real with yourself. Are you chasing what you truly want or what you think you should want?

Now, don’t get me wrong, this card isn’t here to crush your vibe. It’s more like a friend who’s willing to be brutally honest while still rooting for you. Spirit’s telling you to check your expectations and cut through the fog. If you’ve been relying on wishful thinking, it’s time to get your feet back on the ground and figure out what you can actually control. That might mean facing some uncomfortable truths about your plans, your relationships, or your own self-beliefs.

In practical terms, maybe you’ve been putting off decisions or avoiding the hard conversations because it feels easier to hope for a miracle. But the Star reversed says you’ve got to do the work. It’s time to swap out fantasy for facts, even if the facts are messy or disappointing. Trust me, you knew before you said it. This is the card that wants you to stop half-believing and start acting with clarity, even if that means shedding some illusions.

So, yeah, it might feel like a dimmer switch on your usual optimism, but it’s also a call to be fiercely honest with yourself. Don’t settle for false hope. It’s okay to admit that things aren’t perfect or that your plan needs a rewrite. That’s not failure; that’s just the part where you get to rebuild smarter, not harder. Keep your eyes open for the small, steady truths beneath the noise — they’ll guide you better than any wishful thinking ever could. OK.

When you stand here, caught between what you want to say and what you’re actually willing to admit, the tension is thick. You knew before you said it. That moment when your mind races faster than your mouth, trying to weigh the risk of truth against the comfort of silence. Relationships don’t come with instruction manuals, but they do come with endless reruns of what you wish you’d done differently. The influence locked in those decisions makes it harder to breathe, but also sharper in focus. It’s like you’re holding onto a conversation that’s already moved on without you.

Money matters are sitting in the background, quietly waiting for their turn to demand attention. Some of you are juggling bills with the finesse of someone who’s been doing this too long and others are staring at contracts or offers that should feel like progress but instead feel like another layer of uncertainty. You’ve been thinking about the future, but here’s the kicker—it’s the present that’s got you tangled. That call you hesitate to make, the email you keep rewriting, the paperwork you push aside because the deadline’s still hours away. It’s all piling up in the corners of your daily routine, refusing to be ignored.

And speaking of daily routine, have you noticed how some habits stick not because they serve you, but because they’re familiar? You might be caught in patterns that feel like autopilot, even though every fiber of your being knows you need to shift gears. Sometimes the hardest part isn’t the change itself but admitting that the current rhythm no longer fits. Whether it’s how you show up for yourself or what you tolerate from others, those small, repeated choices add up to the life you have right now. It’s uncomfortable, sure, but also necessary if you want to rewrite the narrative.

There’s also this undercurrent of needing to trust your instincts more. Not the ones that yell over every little bump, but the quiet, steady voice that reminds you of what’s true beneath the noise. You don’t have to have it all figured out, but you do owe it to yourself to listen harder and lean into that clarity when it comes. Don’t lie to yourself—you already clocked this. The fear of making the wrong move is real, but the greater risk is standing still because you’re afraid to step forward.

If there’s one action to consider right now, it’s this: pick up the phone or draft that message you’ve been avoiding. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be real. The rest will fall into place as it’s meant to. You have all the tools you need, even if it feels like you don’t.
