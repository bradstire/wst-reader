Hey Taurus! November is nudging you, and I’m seeing you’re not quite ready to drop your guard yet. That vibe of holding on tight, eyes peeled even when you want to blink—it’s there. You’re watching, waiting, but also tired. Not from nothing, though. You caught the signs. You knew before you said it.

Nine of Wands. Oh wow. This card is standing firm, worn but not broken. You’ve been through something rough. Maybe it’s a fight you didn’t ask for, or a grind that’s been dragging on way too long. Whatever it is, you’re not folding. You’re that person who’s been hit, stood back up, and squared your shoulders again. But here’s the thing—there’s a weight, a weariness under this presence. You’re not just defending; you’re bracing for whatever’s next.

I’m seeing some uneven give-and-take underneath this, too. That’s where the reversed card sneaks in, messing with the balance. You might be giving more than you’re getting back—whether it’s time, effort, or your emotional energy. Maybe you’re still trying to keep things afloat even when the other side isn’t pitching in. That’s exhausting, right? You’re stuck in this loop of trying to keep your footing, but the support just isn’t steady.

And then there’s this influence whispering behind the scenes—this is your wish card, your "I want this" card. It’s like you’re holding on with one hand but hoping the other gets you something better. You want that emotional satisfaction, the kind that feels full and real. But it’s not here yet. You might be telling yourself you’re okay, but inside, you know you’re craving more. You’re tired of fighting just to get scraps.

You’re in this space where you’re guarded but hoping. You’re tired but not done. It’s like you’re holding a door shut with all your might, but part of you wants to swing it open to something that feels good—something that fills you up instead of draining you. You see the pattern. You feel the strain of uneven energy around you. You’re trying to protect your heart and your peace.

Don’t lie to yourself—you saw this coming. You knew the uneven give-and-take was a problem. You might’ve ignored it for a bit, hoping it would fix itself, but nope. It didn’t. Now you’re here, standing your ground but wondering how much longer you’ll want to keep doing it. The days of putting all your energy into one-sided situations? They’re fading.

Wait, I’m seeing something else with this. This isn’t just about defense—it’s about resilience. You’re not just protecting; you’re preparing. You’re setting up boundaries because you know what’s worth fighting for. But you’re also at a point where you want to feel that deep satisfaction, the kind that fills your cup without draining you dry. This influence behind this is reminding you that you deserve that.

So yeah, you’re tired, but you’re still here. That’s the key. You’re not giving up, but you’re learning where to stop bending. You’re sensing when the balance tips too far, and you’re ready to call it out. That’s huge. Keep that in mind.

Okay. So. Hmm. Wait. Yeah.

Queen of Swords, reversed. Oh wow.

Okay, so this card is flashing “cut the crap” but in total denial about the blade’s edge. You see it in the way things twist under this presence — like you’re trying to talk yourself into a story that doesn’t hold water. You’re replaying conversations, but the real message? It’s getting lost in a fog of excuses or maybe even some serious self-sabotage. People around you might be tossing in some shade, or maybe you’re the one tossing it at yourself. This influence feeding into this, is a big red flag. It’s like the balance is off — give and take isn’t happening as it should. Someone’s holding back, or maybe you have been, and it’s starting to show in the way trust cracks and promises feel hollow.

You knew before you even said it, right? That hesitation in your voice, that pause before trying to defend what’s clearly shaky ground. You’re guarding yourself like the Nine of Wands suggests — battle-ready, bruised, unwilling to drop your guard. But the Queen of Swords, reversed? She’s the sharp intellect gone sideways. Instead of clear, honest thinking, it’s muddled with bitterness or a refusal to see the truth. This is not about being cold or distant on purpose — it’s more like the mind is stuck in a loop, refusing to cut loose from old wounds or outdated ideas.

And then there’s that influence whispering “you want this to feel good again.” That’s the part that’s tricky. You want the comfort, the win, the wish-come-true vibe. But the Queen reversed tells me you’re not letting yourself have that clarity to get there. Like you’re holding a grudge against your own intuition. Maybe you’re afraid of what it will say if you stop spinning the story. That fear is freezing your next move.

Look, it’s okay to admit the scales are tipping. You might be giving too much where you don’t get enough back, or you’re expecting fairness from someone who’s not wired that way. The problem is, with the Queen reversed, you’re not calling it out cleanly. Instead, you’re stuck in a mental game of “if I just explain this enough, it’ll fix itself.” Spoiler: It won’t. You’re exhausting yourself trying to make sense of nonsense.

Watch your boundaries here. The Nine of Wands energy means you’re tired but still fighting. Smart move to protect yourself. But don’t let this reversed Queen talk you into a battle you can’t win by reason alone. Sometimes the sharpest move is to stop arguing with the facts and start acting on what you actually know is true.

You’re craving that good feeling under the surface, but to get there, you have to drop the act of pretending you’re in control of the story. It’s messy, sure. But clarity doesn’t come from twisting your own words. It comes from calling things out as they are — even if that means admitting you’ve been the one holding back the fairness you want.

You feeling this? This is the point where you decide if you keep spinning or if you cut through the noise and choose the clearer path. The tension is real. The stakes? Your peace. Yeah.

Two of Wands, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so this one’s sitting sideways, and it’s not subtle. You’ve been stuck at the same spot, spinning your wheels on decisions you thought you'd made already. Maybe you thought you had a clear plan, but now, it’s like everything’s just... Paused. You’re caught between what you want and what you think you should do, but neither side is winning. It’s that weird place where the future looks different, but you can’t quite step into it yet.

You knew this was coming, right? The current from the Queen of Swords reversed was already shouting “cut the crap” but here you are, still hesitating. That foggy, indecisive vibe is thick. Maybe you’re second-guessing yourself, or someone’s been gaslighting you into doubting your own instincts. The Queen reversed doesn’t sugarcoat it: this is a power struggle happening in your head or out loud, and it’s messing with your clarity. You’re sensing unfairness underneath it all, like someone’s holding back what they owe you, or you’re not getting the balance you deserve. This influence sneaks in here like a warning sign—don’t let yourself get played or drained.

And the Nine of Wands? That’s the fight in you. You’ve been defending your ground longer than you want. Maybe your jaw is tight because you’re tired of looking over your shoulder, waiting for the next hit. You’re worn out but still standing. This card screams, “Enough is enough,” but the Two of Wands reversed says you haven’t yet found the way to truly walk away or change direction.

What’s feeding into this? That influence all. That’s your wish, your heart’s real pull—wanting satisfaction, feeling like your gut knows what’s best, even if your head’s still foggy. You want to feel content, but right now, you’re caught in the middle of a mismatch: the fight to protect yourself versus the fear of missing out on what you want next.

Here’s the kicker—you’re in a holding pattern because you’re waiting for someone else to step up or for the situation to magically resolve itself. But that’s not happening. The pileup of “I should” and “What if” is blocking your view. You’re not crazy for feeling stuck or frustrated. This is what happens when the scales are tipped, and you’re not getting the fairness you need to move on. It’s exhausting, and it’s draining your energy.

You might be tempted to keep playing it safe, but that’s exactly what this card warns against. The current underneath—those reversed card vibes—say you’re giving more than you’re getting, or someone else is holding the cards. So ask yourself: what are you really waiting for? Is it permission? A sign? Or are you just afraid to take the hit and lose what little control you have?

Text someone you trust. Say what you’re really feeling. Or if that’s too much, write it down—get it out of your head. The Nine of Wands says you’ve got some fight left, but the Two of Wands reversed calls out the hesitancy. Your next move is about breaking free from the freeze, even if it’s just one small step forward.

Yeah.

Six of Swords. Hmm.

You’re moving. Not just moving through space but shifting something real. Maybe you’re done with the fights, the doubts, the constant looking over your shoulder. This card doesn’t show you sailing into some perfect sunset. No, it’s about leaving behind what’s heavy enough to slow you down, even if you don’t have a clear view of what’s next. You knew this, didn’t you? That tension in your gut? The feeling that whatever’s been dragging on isn’t gonna fix itself.

Look back a second. The Nine of Wands was you standing guard, worn out but not folding. You stayed in the ring longer than most would. The Queen of Swords, reversed? That’s the mental fog or the harsh words you swallowed or maybe threw out when you shouldn’t have. Communication got messy—cut too deep or left you confused. Then the Two of Wands, reversed, was the stuck moment. Like you had the options but couldn’t pick a path, or the fear of the unknown froze you in place. So here you are, finally pushing off from that shore.

Now, the Six of Swords isn’t about escape or running away—it’s about choosing peace over chaos. But the current underneath is tricky. This influence lurking below this, signals imbalance. You might be carrying more than your share or feeling like the give-and-take in your life is way off. Maybe you’ve been the one giving, expecting nothing back, and now it’s catching up to you. Or maybe you’re the one needing help but refusing to ask. That’s the kind of baggage you don’t want to bring into this transition.

This influence is tucked in as a reminder—what you want is there. Satisfaction, contentment, a moment where you can breathe without looking over your shoulder. But it’s not just about wishful thinking. It’s about taking the move you’re making seriously, even if it’s scary. You could still be holding onto old wounds or bitterness from the Queen of Swords upside down. The sharp edges of betrayal or harsh words might still sting, making it harder to embrace this new phase.

Here’s the catch: if you keep dragging the past or the feeling that you’re owed something, you won’t get far. The Six of Swords demands you put your hands on the oars, even if the water’s rough. You know the struggle isn’t over, but you’re choosing a different fight—the one for peace. You’re not just walking away; you’re steering toward something less chaotic, less exhausting.

For some of you, this is about actual physical distance—moving apartments, changing jobs, or cutting ties with toxic people. For others, it’s internal. A shift in mindset, a new way of setting boundaries after the Queen of Swords reversed showed you what happens when you don’t. Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew some part of you was stuck in the Two of Wands, reversed, not ready to take the leap. Now, you’re forced to take it anyway.

This card asks what you’re willing to leave behind. The anger, the confusion, the uneven give-and-take. And what you’re willing to carry forward—the lessons, the clarity, the hope. The Nine of Wands said you’re tough. You’re not fragile or gullible. But toughness without direction just burns you out. The Six of Swords says you’re done with that.

So, what’s next? You keep moving, even if it’s uncomfortable. You don’t have to have it all figured out. You don’t have to be ready. You just have to start. And remember—if they wanted to help, they would. If they wanted to make it easier, they would. This is your move. Your peace. Your choice.

Mm.

Judgement, reversed. Oh wow. Right out the gate, this card is waving its flag like, “Hey, you’re not quite done here,” but it’s not the usual call to action. Nope, it’s more like a soft warning that you might be stuck in some kind of loop — that mental or emotional rerun you’ve been trying to ignore. You know, that nagging feeling when you’re almost ready to move on but something’s holding you back, and it’s not even clear what exactly. You sensed this — you already clocked this.

This is a soft “hold up” from Spirit, but it’s dressed in hesitation and resistance. The reversed Judgement here is not about a big reveal or a triumphant rebirth; it’s more like the universe giving you a nudge to check your blind spots. Maybe you’re avoiding a truth you don’t want to face, or you’re caught in guilt or regret that’s keeping you from stepping fully into what’s next. That energy of accountability and awakening that usually comes with this card? It’s taking a rain check. It’s paused, stalled, or maybe even ignored.

I’m seeing a vibe of unfinished business wrapped up in self-doubt or fear of change. You could be wrestling with a decision that feels heavier than it should, like you’ve been staring at the same options too long, but neither feels right. The supporting energies—this influence plus this vibe—are throwing some light on this. That pull is hinting at imbalance, maybe unfair give and take, or generosity that’s been withheld. On top of that, this force normally promises satisfaction and emotional fulfillment, but here it’s almost like a reminder of what you want but haven’t fully claimed yet.

It’s almost like you’re waiting for some grand moment of clarity or forgiveness to come crashing down, but it’s not showing up. Instead, you’re caught between what you’ve given and what you’ve received, questioning if you were too generous or not generous enough, maybe in relationships or even with yourself. That internal ledger isn’t adding up, and it’s messing with your confidence. It’s one of those moments when you realize the external validation you crave isn’t going to land until you make peace internally.

I’m getting that the Queen of Swords reversed earlier was trying to cut through the fog but maybe got tangled up in overthinking or harsh self-judgment. You might be spinning in mental loops instead of slicing cleanly through to truth. And with the Two of Wands reversed, the current of planning or future vision feels blocked—like you’re hesitating because you’re not sure if you can trust your own judgment right now.

Now, the Six of Swords is there, usually signaling a move away from trouble toward calmer waters, but paired with this reversed Judgement, it’s less a clean transition and more of a limbo. You’re in the in-between, but the landing spot isn’t clear. You could be physically moving or emotionally shifting, but something about it feels stuck or incomplete.

I’m feeling like you’re on the edge of a breakthrough, but you’re holding back the last step. It’s like you’re waiting for a sign or a perfect moment that won’t come. You need to make the call even if the water ahead looks uncertain. The universe is not handing you a full “all clear” yet, but it’s not denying the possibility either. You’ve got to own the next move without all the answers lined up.

Don’t fool yourself into thinking you’re powerless here. The call to action is internal: face the unfinished business, the imbalance, the old judgments, and forgive yourself for the missteps. If you don’t, the hesitation becomes a trap. You already know this. The question is—what will you do with that knowing?

Anyway.

Okay, so the thing about being caught in that exhausting space—you know, when you’re guarding your last bit of energy like it’s the last slice of pizza in the box—is that it often feels like you’re the only one playing by the rules. You’re tired, but the game hasn’t ended. And that sharp-edged current? That’s the one where your mind’s trying to cut through the fog, but it’s a little dull today. You catch yourself overthinking every move, second-guessing the “what ifs,” and suddenly, options that once seemed exciting now look like… Well, a mess. Not even a detour; more like a dead end in a parking lot you’ve circled too many times.

Wait—do you feel that? That hesitation, that chill of uncertainty, especially when it comes to decisions that could shift your whole scene? Sometimes, the universe seems to be putting a pause on the “big leap” energy, and what’s left is this weird limbo where the possibilities feel smaller, or worse, stuck. That’s what I’m seeing here. You’re at a point where you’ve tried to balance giving and receiving, but it’s all off-kilter. The scales are tipping in a way that leaves you wondering if the effort's even worth it. You felt this already—something’s been out of sync for a while.

And that’s the kicker, isn’t it? Wanting more, but feeling like you’re not getting the emotional payoff you hoped for. The “wish come true” card is hanging out, but it’s a little distant, like the promise of satisfaction is there—but not quite in reach. Maybe you’ve been chasing a feeling or a situation that doesn’t want to settle in, or maybe you’ve settled and now you’re wondering if that’s enough. It might be time to question what you’re really holding on to and why. Is it the comfort of familiarity, or fear of the unknown?

Look, it’s okay to admit that sometimes the path forward isn’t straight. You’re moving through a phase where the usual clarity isn’t handing you answers on a silver platter. It’s more like a puzzle missing its corner pieces, and you’re squinting at the shapes, trying to figure out what fits. That energy of moving away from something difficult is there, but the destination is cloudy. It’s like you’re trying to leave a rough patch but you’re not sure if you’re stepping into something better or just another set of challenges.

So here’s a thought: what if the call you’re hesitating over—the one that feels like it could change everything—is less about the other person or situation and more about you setting a boundary? Maybe it’s a “no,” or maybe it’s a “I need time.” Not everything requires a grand gesture. Sometimes the bravest move is to just pause, breathe, and give yourself permission to not have it all figured out immediately.

You feeling this? Because the current here is real. It’s messy, it’s uncomfortable, but it’s also a sign that you’re not settling quietly anymore. That’s progress. The scales might be tipping, but you’re still holding the power to decide what stays and what goes. And that’s a kind of strength that doesn’t come from ignoring the red flags—it comes from facing them head-on, even if it means stepping into uncertainty.
