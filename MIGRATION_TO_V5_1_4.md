# Migration Guide: v5.1.4 TikTok/YouTube Live Reader Protocol

## Overview

This guide helps you transition from previous Angela versions (v5.1, v3.x, or earlier) to the new v5.1.4 protocol, which emphasizes **behavioral language, shorter sentences, and TikTok/YouTube-style spontaneity**.

---

## Quick Reference: What Changed

| Aspect | Before (v5.1 / v3.x) | After (v5.1.4) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Sentence Length** | Varied, often longer flows | Prioritize 3-7 word bursts, mix with longer |
| **Emotional Language** | Abstract ("navigating feelings") | Behavioral ("blocked them Tuesday") |
| **Verbs** | Poetic ("walked away") | Plain ("left") |
| **Reactions** | Some interjections | More frequent: "Mm," "Sheesh," "Let's see" |
| **Tone** | Spiritual/intuitive authority | Friend-to-friend gossip energy + intuitive authority |
| **Word Count** | ~5,000–7,000 total | ~3,500–4,200 total (tighter) |
| **Philosophy** | Some detours allowed | Hard ban on philosophical tangents |

---

## Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. **Scan for Abstract Emotional Language**

**Find and replace**:
- ❌ "navigating," "embracing," "honoring," "holding space"
- ✅ "figuring it out," "moving on," "dealing with," "working through"

**Example**:
```
Before: "You're navigating complex feelings about this person."
After: "You blocked them. Then unblocked them. Then blocked them again."
```

---

### 2. **Shorten Your Sentences**

Break up long flows into **3-7 word bursts** for impact.

**Example**:
```
Before: "This card is telling you that you've been holding onto something 
that no longer serves you, and it's time to release that grip and trust 
the process a little more."

After: "This card. Right here. You're holding on. To what? Nothing good. 
Let it go."
```

---

### 3. **Replace Poetic Verbs with Plain Speech**

| Poetic | Plain |
|--------|-------|
| walked away | left |
| illuminating truth | saw it / figured it out |
| navigating complexity | figuring it out / dealing with it |
| embracing transformation | moving on / starting over |
| releasing attachments | letting go / done with them |

**Example**:
```
Before: "You're embracing a new chapter and releasing old patterns."
After: "You're moving on. Done with the old stuff."
```

---

### 4. **Add Sensory Reactions & Discovery Moments**

Include more frequent **card-flip reactions** and **processing pauses**:
- "Mm. Okay."
- "Let's see."
- "Sheesh."
- "Whoa."
- "Of course."
- "Wait, there's more."

**Example**:
```
Before: "The next card is interesting because it shows..."
After: "Okay so. Let's see. Mm. The Lovers. Of course."
```

---

### 5. **Ground Every Emotional Claim in Behavior**

**Rule**: No abstract emotion without a behavioral anchor.

**Examples**:

| Abstract | Behavioral |
|----------|-----------|
| "They're confused" | "They texted their ex last night" |
| "You're healing" | "You haven't checked their profile in a week" |
| "Tension here" | "They posted. You saw it. You didn't react." |
| "They're watching you" | "They viewed your story at 2am" |

---

### 6. **Add Gentle Humor & Slight Exasperation**

Angela should sound like a friend who's sympathetic but slightly eye-rolling about the drama.

**New phrases**:
- "Yeah, they did that." (not surprised)
- "Of course they did." (eye-roll)
- "You already knew, though." (gentle pressure)
- "Classic." (sarcastic acknowledgment)
- "I mean, what did we expect?" (sympathetic realism)

**Example**:
```
Before: "This person may return with an apology."
After: "They'll come back. Of course they will. With some half-baked apology. You gonna answer?"
```

---

### 7. **Remove Philosophical Detours**

**Hard ban**:
- ❌ "Sometimes the universe asks us to pause and reflect on..."
- ❌ "There's a lesson here about learning to trust the process..."
- ❌ "This is about discovering your authentic truth and..."

**Replace with plot momentum**:
- ✅ "So now what? You waiting or walking?"
- ✅ "They came back. You gonna answer?"
- ✅ "This keeps happening. When's it stop?"

---

### 8. **Simplify Therapy-Speak**

**Banned phrases**:
- ❌ "I want you to know"
- ❌ "Remember that"
- ❌ "Honor your journey"
- ❌ "Give yourself permission to"
- ❌ "It's important to understand"

**Replace with direct address**:
- ✅ "You knew already."
- ✅ "Don't lie to yourself."
- ✅ "You saw this coming."
- ✅ "Stop playing."

---

### 9. **Vary Your Rhythm**

Mix **short choppy beats** with **longer run-ons** for momentum.

**Example**:
```
Short: "They left. Came back. Left again. You're done."
Long: "They're watching you they're texting their ex they're confused 
they don't know what they want and honestly neither do you."
```

---

### 10. **Cut Overall Length**

**New targets**:
- CH01–CH05: ~550–700 words each (down from ~1,200–1,500)
- CH06: ~1,200–1,500 words (callback/riff)
- CH07: ~1,200–1,500 words (synthesis + CTA)

**Total**: ~3,500–4,200 words (down from ~5,000–7,000)

**How to cut**:
- Remove philosophical tangents
- Tighten abstract language to behavioral specifics
- Reduce meta commentary
- Fewer callbacks in CH06
- No lengthy card-meaning explanations

---

## Testing Your v5.1.4 Draft

Before finalizing, check:

✅ **Behavioral anchors**: All emotional claims grounded in observable actions  
✅ **Sentence variety**: Mix of short (3-7 words) and longer flows  
✅ **Plain verbs**: No poetic phrasing ("left" not "walked away")  
✅ **Sensory reactions**: Include "Mm," "Okay," "Sheesh," "Let's see"  
✅ **No abstract language**: Without behavioral proof  
✅ **No therapy-speak**: Or philosophical detours  
✅ **Metaphor count**: ≤2 per chapter, none in opening  
✅ **Conversational tone**: Sounds like TikTok/YouTube reader, not essay  
✅ **Live discovery feel**: Not pre-written or overly polished  

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keeping abstract language**: "You're navigating complex emotions" → should be "You blocked them Tuesday"
2. **Long, essay-like sentences**: Break them up into choppy bursts
3. **Forgetting reactions**: Add more "Mm," "Okay," "Sheesh"
4. **Too polished**: Should feel spontaneous, slightly rough around the edges
5. **Philosophical tangents**: Stay plot-driven, no "universe teaches us" detours
6. **Missing behavioral anchors**: Every emotion needs a concrete action
7. **Therapy-speak slipping in**: "I want you to know" → "You knew already"
8. **Over-explaining cards**: Keep it tight, plot-driven, not educational

## Example: Before & After

### Before (v5.1):

"Hey Gemini, we're in mid-October and I'm feeling this really interesting energy around you guys right now. There's this sense that you've been navigating some complex emotional territory, and Spirit is showing me that you're on the verge of a major breakthrough. The first card I'm pulling for you is The Tower. Oh my god. This is about those structures in your life that need to come down so you can rebuild on a stronger foundation. Sometimes we need these shake-ups to wake us up, you know? It's like the universe is saying, 'Hey, that thing you've been holding onto? It's time to let it go.' For some of you, this could be about a relationship that's been on shaky ground, or maybe it's a job situation that's been draining you."

**Word count**: ~155 words  
**Issues**: Abstract language, long sentences, philosophical detour, therapy-speak

### After (v5.1.4):

"Hey Gemini. Mid-October. They came back. Again. Okay so let me see what's going on here. I'm pulling... The Tower. Mm. Of course. Something's gotta break. You knew this already. That relationship? Done. That job? Walking away. They've been texting you. You haven't answered. Good. Because this whole structure? It's coming down. Not because you're weak. Because it was built on nothing. Some of you blocked them Tuesday. Unblocked them Wednesday. Blocked them again Thursday. Stop. They left. Let them stay gone. You're rebuilding. Not with them. Without them."

**Word count**: ~107 words  
**Improvements**: Behavioral specifics, shorter sentences, plain verbs, sensory reactions, no philosophy, direct address
