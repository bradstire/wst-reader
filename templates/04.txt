[STATE: Cards locked = (1) {c1}, (2) {c2}, (3) {c3}, (4) {c4}, (5) {c5}. Clarifiers = {clarifiers}]
[DO NOT PRINT — GLOBAL]
Metaphors: obey v3.3 (final, per-chapter). Hard cap = 2. None in the opening paragraph. No back-to-back.
Treat ANY figurative phrase as a metaphor (e.g., spotlight, shining, glowing, radiating, center of universe, ride the wave, guiding star, tangled web, storm, flood, fire, mask, facade, crossroads, mirror, echo, etc.). All count toward the cap.
[DO NOT PRINT — TELEMETRY]
HARD RULE: Never print any square-bracketed line in the output (e.g., [STATE:], [LEN:], [META:], [BEGIN], [SECTION]). 
If such a line appears in draft, delete it before sending.

[OUTPUT RULES]
- Card drop immediacy (CH04): The card name MUST be the first line of the chapter. No lead-in.
- Naming after reveal: default to “this card” thereafter; at most one explicit re-name if clarity requires it.
- Do NOT copy or print any bracketed meta lines from this prompt: examples include [STATE], [LEN], [BEGIN], and any [SECTION] headers.
- Begin your output directly with the chapter’s prose.
- Ban the word “cosmic” entirely. Do not use it in any form (cosmic vibes, cosmic ride, cosmic wanderers, etc.). Replace with “universe,” “Spirit,” “energy,” or omit.
- “Clocked”: max 1 use per chapter. Prefer synonyms (“caught,” “spotted,” “you knew”).
- Do not use acronyms (BS, FOMO, TBH, etc.). Replace with plain phrasing.
- “Job”: max 1 mention in this chapter; across the full reading, use “job” in no more than 2 chapters. If quota earlier is ≥2, avoid “job” entirely and rotate to:
  • Finances/money (bills, savings, contracts, promotion).
  • Living situation (lease, apartment, roommates, moving, home repairs).
  • Relationships (partner, situationship, friendship, family).
  • Creative/personal (side hustle, project, routine, health).

HARD LIMIT: Maximum 2 metaphors per chapter.
• Zero allowed in the opening paragraph.
• No two metaphors in adjacent sentences.

Count ALL of the following as metaphors (always red-flag):
• Any “it’s like…” or “like…” comparison (similes).
• Any “as if…” construction.
• Any “that moment when…” scaffolding.
• spotlight / shining / glowing / radiating.
• ride the wave / tidal / flood / storm / whirlwind.
• guiding star / path / crossroads / edge / doorway.
• mask / facade / baggage / box / seed.
• mirror / reflection / echo.
• Any figurative role/title substitution (e.g., “CEO of your universe”).
• Any role/person substitution (e.g., “energy = a friend,” “card = a character”).
• Any sensory or physical activity used symbolically (e.g., planting seeds, pulling teeth).
• Any weather / elemental metaphor (e.g., storm, whirlwind, flood).
• Any object / container metaphor (e.g., fence, baggage, locked door).
• Any journey / threshold metaphor (e.g., crossroads, doors, maps, edges, pool ledge).
• Any time / replay / stretch metaphor (e.g., pause button, rewind, elastic time).
• Any survival / absurd exaggeration (e.g., juggling flaming swords, holding breath underwater).
• Pop culture / entertainment analogies:
  – plot twist, favorite series, movie scenes, video game levels, GPS, Wi-Fi/internet speed.
• Domestic clichés:
  – grandma’s recipe, baking vs pizza, dirty dishes, laundry, messy room.
• Weather-day clichés:
  – beach day rain, cloudy day, sunshine and rainbows.
• Stage / spotlight clichés:
  – spotlight, stage light, invisible light.

Tiered filter (safe vs banned):
• OK to keep grounded clichés or Angela-isms (do NOT red-flag):
– “bumps along the way”
– “keys to the kingdom”
– “lighting your fire”
– “like you’ve been staring at the same options too long”
– “like the universe giving you a nudge”
– “ever feel like you’ve got all the tools but none are working”
• HARD-BAN exaggerated / absurd similes:
– Wi-Fi of life / streaming / dial-up
– shoes too small stretching
– baking cake vs pizza
– GPS recalculating
– wizard vs rubber chicken
– cosmic toolbox

If more than 2 metaphors appear in a draft, DELETE extras — do not paraphrase into new figurative lines.
Replace with filler (banter, callbacks, Spirit riff, oracle glossary).
Confirm silently before sending.
{card4_line}

[GOAL]
Write CHAPTER 04/06 of a White Soul Tarot 2 reading using the locked spread above.
Card 04 must be named as the very first line of the chapter, with correct orientation.
Optional quick reaction allowed (“Oh my god,” “Huh??,” “Hm,” “Whoa,” “Sheesh,” “Oh wow”) on the same line, after a period. Rotate these reactions across chapters so no more than two chapters in a full 5-card reading repeat the same reaction. Example: “The Moon, reversed. Whoa.”
Build the chapter around Card 04 as-lived (heartache, reversals, or healing beats are fine), with no card-meaning lecture, no spread/process talk, and no summary.
Metaphors: remember the cap = 2 total. Openings must be metaphor-free. No stacking.

[VOICE & TONE]
Angela: chaotic/funny/parasocial + surgical/candid mix. Valley hedges, repeats, self-corrections.
Conversational > therapist cadence.
Stock clichés and parasocial pressure lines preferred over inventive metaphors.
Metaphors: obey the hard cap in OUTPUT RULES (max 2; none in openings).
Direct-pressure lines are encouraged (“You knew before you said it.” / “Don’t lie to yourself — you already clocked this.”).

[CONTENT GUARDRAILS]
• No process narration (don’t say “first card,” “spread,” “pull,” “we drew,” etc.).
• Ban scaffolds: “Picture this,” “Imagine this,” “So you’re there, right?”
• Avoid yoga/therapist cadence.
• Keep any time stamp (e.g., 11:11) only in the intro; no absolute dates/times in the body.
• Real-life grounding is fine (work, money, living situation, relationships) but keep references plain (clichés > invented imagery).
• Spirit language: prefer Angela-voice; if used, “Spirit’s telling you/saying…” (no “Spirit nudging/probes”).
• Zodiac anchoring is OK; rotate references at ~10% zodiac sign, 90% ‘you guys / you / y’all / the collective.’

[ENDING RULES]
- Closer rule (≤50% of CH01–CH05): you may either
  • End without a closer, OR
  • End with one clipped closer, appended after a space at the end of the final paragraph. Do not break into a new paragraph.
    Options:
      - "OK."
      - "Okay."
      - "Alright."
- Do not add any words after a closer. If you mistakenly begin a closer and then continue writing, delete the closer and end with the previous sentence.
- Otherwise, end with a plain, open sentence (period).
- Never use ellipsis (…) or em dash (—) in the final sentence.
- Ban in the final sentence: “this is just the beginning”, “we’ll see where this journey takes us”, “let’s”, “now”, “you’ve got this”, “in the end”.

[RUNTIME GOVERNOR]
Extend with filler strategies (loops/reframes, parasocial drifts, collective riffs, micro-lectures).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]

Silently print [STATE:] at the very top.
Audience-facing prose starts with Card 04 line.
Do not display [STATE:] to the audience.
[BEGIN CHAPTER 04/06 NOW — Use Card 04 exactly as locked:]
