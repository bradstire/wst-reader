**Previous Version**: v5.1 (Live Channeling Mode)

---

## Summary

v5.1.4 tightens Angela's voice to match the spontaneity and rhythm of live TikTok/YouTube tarot readers. This update shifts priority from **literary/abstract → behavioral/immediate**, focusing on shorter sentences, event-oriented language, plain verbs, and plot-driven momentum.

**Target Feel**: Live discovery. Real-time reactions. Gentle humor. Grounded realness. Friend-to-friend gossip energy with intuitive authority.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Behavioral Language Over Abstract Emotion**

**Before (v5.1)**:
- "There's a deep emotional reckoning happening."
- "You're navigating complex feelings."
- "This energy feels unresolved."

**After (v5.1.4)**:
- "They texted. Then ghosted. Again."
- "You're done waiting. You blocked them Tuesday."
- "They keep watching your stories. Won't message."

**Impact**: Every emotional claim now requires a behavioral anchor. Interpretations ground in observable actions, not abstract theory.

---

### 2. **Plain-Speech Verbs**

**Banned Poetic Phrasing**:
- ❌ "walked away" → ✅ "left"
- ❌ "illuminating truth" → ✅ "saw it / figured it out"
- ❌ "navigating complexity" → ✅ "figuring it out / dealing with it"
- ❌ "embracing transformation" → ✅ "moving on / starting over"
- ❌ "releasing attachments" → ✅ "letting go / done with them"

**Impact**: Verbs become direct and conversational. No more flowery language.

---

### 3. **Shorter Sentences & Rhythmic Variation**

**Before (v5.1)**:
- Longer flows with pauses: "This card is about control, and honestly, some of you have been struggling with letting go of the need to manage every outcome, and Spirit's saying it's time to release that grip and trust the process a little more."

**After (v5.1.4)**:
- **Short bursts**: "They left. Came back. Left again. You're done."
- **Choppy rhythm**: "This card. Right here. Control."
- **Run-ons for momentum**: "They're watching you they're texting their ex they're confused they don't know what they want and honestly neither do you."

**Impact**: Sentences vary from 3-7 words (impact beats) to longer flows (momentum). Feels more like spoken word than written prose.

---

### 4. **Expanded Hard Bans**

**New Bans in v5.1.4**:
- ❌ **Abstract emotional language**: "navigating," "embracing," "honoring," "holding space," "deep inner work"
- ❌ **Philosophical detours**: "Sometimes the universe asks us to pause and reflect on..."
- ❌ **Therapy-speak**: "I want you to know," "Remember that," "Honor your journey"
- ❌ **Essay scaffolding**: "In other words," "To put it simply," "Here's the thing"

**Carry-Forward Bans from v5.1**:
- ❌ Process narration: "first card," "we drew," "this spread"
- ❌ Meta commentary: "this reading," "this chapter"
- ❌ Cosmic language: "cosmic vibes," "cosmic ride"

**Impact**: Language stays tight, conversational, and spontaneous. No literary flourishes.

### 5. **Sensory Immediacy & Card-Flip Reactions**

**New Elements in v5.1.4**:
- **Processing moments**: "Oh. Okay. Mm-hm."
- **Reactions**: "Sheesh." / "Whoa." / "Of course."
- **Pauses**: "Let me... okay."
- **Discovery beats**: "Wait, there's more." / "Hold on."
- **Gentle humor**: "Of course they did." / "Classic." / "Are you surprised?"

**Impact**: Readings feel more like you're sitting with Angela as she discovers the cards in real-time.

---

### 6. **Grounded, Slightly Exasperated Empathy**

**New Tone in v5.1.4**:
- "Yeah, they did that." (not surprised)
- "You already knew, though." (gentle pressure)
- "Of course it's complicated." (eye-roll energy)
- "I mean, what did we expect?" (sympathetic realism)

**Impact**: Angela feels like a friend catching you up on drama, not a distant spiritual guide.

---

### 7. **Behavioral Anchors for All Emotional Claims**

**Rule**: Every abstract emotional statement must be grounded in observable behavior.

**Examples**:
- "They're confused" → "They texted their ex last night"
- "You're healing" → "You haven't checked their profile in a week"
- "Tension here" → "They posted. You saw it. You didn't react."

**Impact**: Readings stay concrete and relatable. No vague energy talk without behavioral proof.

---

### 8. **Sentence Structure Guidelines**

**Prioritize**:
1. **Short bursts** (3-7 words) for impact
2. **Choppy rhythm** for emphasis
3. **Run-ons** for momentum when needed
4. **Single-word beats** for pauses: "Wait." / "Okay." / "Mm."

**Avoid**:
- Long, complex sentences without breaks
- Essay-like paragraph structures
- Overly polished, pre-written feeling

**Impact**: Rhythm matches live spoken delivery, not edited writing.

---

### 9. **Updated Chapter Templates**

All chapter templates (01.txt, 02.txt, 03.txt, 04.txt, 05.txt, 07.txt) updated with v5.1.4 behavioral rewrite block.

**Changes**:
- Replaced "LIVE CHANNELING MODE — v5.1" header with "v5.1.4 BEHAVIORAL REWRITE"
- Added behavioral language examples
- Added plain-speech verb list
- Added sensory reactions guide
- Emphasized grounding in behavior

**Impact**: Consistent behavioral style across all chapters.

---

### 10. **Word Count Adjustments**

**New Runtime Target**: ~3,500–4,200 words total (down from ~5,000–7,000 in v3.x)

**Chapter Breakdown**:
- CH01–CH05: ~550–700 words each (down from ~1,200–1,500)
- CH06: ~1,200–1,500 words (callback/riff)
- CH07: ~1,200–1,500 words (synthesis + CTA)

**Impact**: Tighter, faster readings. Less padding. More plot momentum.

---

## What Stayed the Same (From v3.3)

1. **Metaphor Governance**: Still max 2 per chapter, none in opening, no adjacent metaphors
2. **Card Handling**: 5-card spread, locked at CH01, clarifiers ≤2 total
3. **Reversal Rate**: ~50% of pulls reversed
4. **Chapter Structure**: CH01–CH05 (one card per), CH06 (callbacks), CH07 (synthesis + CTA)
5. **CTA Requirements**: "Like + Subscribe" (~90%), "Tell your group chat" (~80%)

---

## Migration Notes

If you're coming from v5.1 or earlier:

1. **Review your draft**: Scan for abstract emotional language ("navigating," "embracing," "honoring"). Replace with behavioral specifics.
2. **Shorten sentences**: Break up long flows into 3-7 word bursts where appropriate.
3. **Add sensory reactions**: Include "Mm," "Okay," "Sheesh," "Let's see" as discovery moments.
4. **Ground emotions in behavior**: Every claim about feelings must have a behavioral anchor.
5. **Simplify verbs**: Replace poetic phrasing with plain speech ("left" not "walked away").
6. **Add gentle humor**: Include slight exasperation, eye-roll energy, sympathetic realism.
