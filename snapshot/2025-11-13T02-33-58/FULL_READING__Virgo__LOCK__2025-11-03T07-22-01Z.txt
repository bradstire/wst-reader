Hey Virgo! November’s just kicked in, and I’m noticing some tension that’s been hanging around, maybe since last week or so. It’s that vibe where you’re trying to be confident but something’s off, like you’re doubting your own moves even though you want to shine. You catch yourself second-guessing, and yeah, it’s draining. 

Queen of Wands, reversed. Oh wow. They're all about trying to light a fire under yourself but feeling stuck instead. You want to be bold, show up strong, and take charge, but something’s blocking that. Maybe you’re overthinking how others see you, or you’re holding back because you’re scared it won’t work out. Either way, this card says your usual spark is dimmed, and that’s frustrating. You might be feeling less like the confident leader and more like someone who’s lost their edge—like you’re playing a role that doesn’t fit anymore. You knew this already, right? You’ve been dragging that low energy around, pretending it’s okay. 

Underneath that, I’m seeing a push for control. This presence’s current is hanging out nearby, telling you there’s a need to set boundaries and take back authority in your life. But here’s the catch: with the Queen of Wands reversed, your way of holding power might be a bit off. You could be too rigid, or maybe too passive, and that’s throwing off your balance. It’s like you want to command the room but feel like you’re whispering instead. That tension between wanting control and feeling powerless is real, and it’s messing with your confidence. This undertone doesn’t want you to give up your power—it wants you to find a better way to own it. 

Then there’s this influence flipped over—so that’s the current that’s stopping you from hitting rock bottom or staying down there. You’re not stuck in defeat, even if it feels like you are. This card tells me you’re in recovery mode, trying to shake off the worst of a burnout or a harsh ending. You’re tired of the pain but maybe not fully ready to move forward yet. It’s a slow climb out, and the Queen of Wands reversed shows you’re still dealing with self-doubt and low current, which makes the comeback feel harder. 

You might catch yourself trying to push through, but it’s like you’re running on empty. You want the fire, but the fuel’s missing. That’s why you’re hesitant or even withdrawing. Don’t lie to yourself—you saw this coming when things got heavy, and you didn’t take care of your own needs. This card is a wake-up call to stop burning your energy with worry or trying to control everything. Instead, focus on rebuilding your strength, even if that means stepping back or saying no. 

I’m seeing some frustration too—maybe with a situation or person that isn’t respecting your boundaries or is making you feel less than you are. The Queen of Wands reversed loves to call that out. You’re done being the “nice” one who keeps the peace at your own expense. But this card also warns against flipping too far the other way, becoming cold or distant. It’s a hard line to walk, but it’s necessary. You want to be fierce but fair, strong but open. 

Right now, you’re in a spot where your confidence is shaky, and your usual way of pushing forward isn’t working. You might be questioning your identity or your role in a relationship, job, or project. That’s where this influence reminds you: structure and discipline can help, but only if you don’t get stuck in rigidity. And that vibe says you’re healing, but the process is slow because you’re still wrestling with self-doubt. 

You get it. This is about finding your fire again without burning out or locking down. You might want to stop trying to pretend you have it all together and instead be honest about what’s draining you. That’s the first step to fixing it. Yeah.

Five of Pentacles. Oh wow.

You’re in that spot where the lights are on but nobody’s home, you know? You felt left out in the cold, like someone shut the door without a warning. This card’s not subtle: it’s showing the aftermath of being cut off, whether that’s money, love, or support. The vibe? You’re walking through a place that’s supposed to feel safe, but it doesn’t. You’re carrying all this weight from being pushed aside or left behind.

Now, paired with that Queen of Wands, reversed, I’m seeing a confidence that got knocked sideways. You tried to hold your fire, keep your energy high, but something—maybe a person or situation—grounded you hard. You might’ve been the one who usually lights up the room, but lately, you’re feeling invisible. You knew that spark was fading before you even said it out loud. It’s like the job of showing up and being “on” got way harder. You’re tired of pretending you’re fine when everything inside says otherwise.

Underneath that, the influence from there's toughening this up. It’s like pressure to take control—but not just any control. Rigid, maybe even stubborn control. You might be trying to force order on chaos, but the current’s pushing back. This vibe here is that no-nonsense boss vibe, but paired with that pull it’s more about recovery than crushing down hard. You’re healing from a bad break, yeah, but the scars are still fresh. You’re trying to rise, but the ground feels shaky.

Watch this: Five of Pentacles isn’t just about loss. It’s about what you do with that loss. You can’t fake your way through this one. You either face it head-on or keep wandering in the dark. And that Queen, reversed? She’s not hiding anymore. She’s cracked open, which sucks but also means something’s shifting inside. You’re done with the mask that says “I got this” when you don’t. That’s progress, whether it feels like it or not.

Money might be tight, or maybe you’re dealing with a fallout in your living situation. Either way, the signals say you’re not alone, even if it feels like it. There’s help nearby—you’re just not seeing it because you’re stuck in survival mode. The trick is to stop walking past the open doors. Look for the support that’s been there's all along, even if it’s not the kind you expected.

You’re carrying more than you signed up for, but here’s the kicker: you’re also stronger than you think. This card asks: what are you willing to leave behind to move forward? Pride? Old habits? That control issue you’ve been wrestling with? You can’t keep holding on to everything and expect to heal. The current beneath this is pushing for a reset, a new way of handling whatever broke you down.

So yeah, you’re in the rough patch. You’re feeling the sting of being left out, overlooked, maybe even abandoned. But the story’s not over. This presence’s grip is firm, but that reversed sword current reminds you there’s a chance to recover, to shift gears. It’s just going to take more than willpower—it’ll take real action. Not the fake kind, the messy, uncomfortable kind.

You get it.  
Mm.

King of Pentacles, reversed. Oh wow.

Okay, so this card is showing up like a warning sign flashing at you, but you’ve been ignoring it for a minute. You knew before you said it out loud: something’s off with the money, the stability, or the people you thought had your back. This king? He’s supposed to be the rock, the one handling the bills, the landlord, the boss who makes things work. But reversed? That means the foundation is shaking. Maybe finances are tight, budgets slipping out of control, or someone in your circle is pretending to be stable when they’re not. Could be a partner, family member, or even you trying to keep it together but running out of steam.

Look, this presence doesn’t hide well. It’s the kind of vibe that makes you check your bank account twice. The Five of Pentacles is right there, too, showing you the cold, the lack, the feeling of being left out in the cold financially or emotionally. You’ve been carrying this weight, and the Queen of Wands, reversed, tells me you’re burned out trying to hold that flame high for everyone else. You’re drained. You’re doubting yourself and maybe questioning if anyone else really cares. That’s the trap—trying to be the fire when you’re already running low on fuel.

What’s feeding into this? This presence this influence are lurking underneath. This current wants order, control, and a plan, but it’s not working right now. You might be dealing with someone rigid, maybe a figure of authority who’s not helping or who’s making demands that feel impossible. And this influence is about recovery, coming back from a betrayal or a rough patch. You’re not quite healed yet, but you’re pushing through. The thing is, the King of Pentacles reversed says you might be holding on to old patterns or people who keep dragging you down financially or emotionally. You could be stuck in a situation that’s no longer sustainable, but walking away feels risky.

You want to chase money, success, security, but maybe you’re chasing the wrong target or the wrong people. The current here says: check who you’re trusting with your resources. Are they really as solid as they claim? Or are you the only one putting in the effort? This card doesn’t mess around. It calls out the fake stability, the cracks under the surface. The Queen of Wands, reversed, paired with the Five of Pentacles, says you’re done pretending everything’s fine. You’re exhausted from carrying the weight of others who aren’t pulling their share.

Here’s the truth—if you keep trying to force control here, you’ll just break yourself more. This influence wants you to get organized, but first, you have to be honest about what’s broken. That might mean cutting loose from a toxic financial setup, a bad roommate situation, or even a relationship that’s draining your energy and resources. You sensed this—you already knew this was coming. This vibe is telling you recovery is possible, but only if you stop the cycle that’s keeping you stuck.

You might need to take a hard look at your budget, your living situation, or your partner’s role in all this. Are you the only one paying the bills? Are you covering for someone else’s mess? The King of Pentacles reversed is a red flag for financial mismanagement or someone unreliable. Maybe it’s you trying to hold everything together while the rest of the crew drops the ball. This isn’t forever; it’s a phase, but it demands action. You have to stop pretending the kingdom is fine when it’s on shaky ground.

So, what’s the move? In the next week, start tracking where your money is going. Be ruthless. Text that roommate or partner who’s been slipping on their share. Set a budget you actually stick to. Don’t let pride stop you from asking for help if you need it. This card is a call to clean house before things get worse. You’re not crazy for feeling frustrated or tired. You’re done carrying dead weight, and it’s time to let that go—even if it hurts.

Yeah.

The Hermit. Oh wow.  

Okay, listen. This one’s all about pulling back when everything else feels like it’s crashing down. You already had the Queen of Wands, reversed, looking off—like the spark just fizzled out or got snuffed by someone else’s cold. Then there’s the Five of Pentacles, which means you’ve been left out in the cold, no surprise there. King of Pentacles reversed adds that extra pinch—money, stability, or someone you thought had their act together? Yeah, that’s shaky too. So, The Hermit shows up, and it’s like the universe saying, “Sit down. Shut up. Look inside.”  

You might’ve been running on fumes, trying to keep the fire alive with the Queen of Wands reversed. That energy’s low, like you’re forcing enthusiasm that just isn’t there's anymore. Maybe you tried to lean on someone, but the Five of Pentacles says you felt more alone than ever. You saw others moving forward, but you were stuck with empty hands. And then the King of Pentacles reversed? That’s the foundation wobbling. Think bills unpaid, promises broken, or just someone who couldn’t be the rock you needed. You felt this already out loud—that steady ground was cracking. You already clocked this.  

So here’s The Hermit stepping in, not as a pity party but as a hard reset. It’s saying you have to pull away, even if it’s uncomfortable. No distractions, no noise, just you with your thoughts. Nobody else is coming to save you, and if they do, does that even help? You’re staring at the facts, no sugarcoating. This card demands you face what’s really going on underneath all that mess. The supporting energies—this presence and that influence—they’re like the silent muscle behind this moment. This current says, “Get control, or at least try.” that influence whispers, “You’re not dead yet. Healing starts here.”  

You might hate the silence. You might want to scream or call someone. But this is about learning to stand alone before you can stand with anyone else. The Hermit doesn’t mean isolation forever; it means doing the work inside so you don’t rely on shaky pillars outside. It’s a tough pill, especially after all that reversal and loss. But it’s necessary.  

Wait, I’m seeing something else—this isn’t about running away either. It’s choosing where to focus your energy. You’ve been spreading yourself thin trying to hold onto something that’s already slipping. The Hermit says: stop. Look at what’s left, what’s real, what’s worth your time. This card is a pause, a deep breath, a moment to gather your scattered pieces and figure out who you are when the noise fades.  

You might have been burning out trying to be the Queen of Wands everyone expected or chasing stability that the King of Pentacles reversed couldn’t deliver. The Hermit says that version of you is on hold. New ideas, fresh boundaries, clearer priorities are coming—but only if you sit with yourself first.  

You get it.

Queen of Cups, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so right out the gate, this card is throwing some serious emotional shade. This isn’t your usual steady, nurturing vibe from the Queen of Cups when she’s upright. No, this one’s all tangled up, like feelings spilled everywhere but no one’s cleaning up. You might be feeling off-center, like your inner compass is wobbling, making it hard to trust your own emotional radar. You knew it deep down: there’s a disconnect somewhere, maybe with yourself or someone close.

It’s like you’re swimming in a pool of your own emotions, but the water’s murky. You want to reach out, to connect, but something keeps getting in the way—maybe it’s fear, maybe it’s exhaustion, or even that old self-doubt creeping back in. And You sensed this—you already clocked this isn’t just a temporary funk. There’s some deeper stuff simmering under the surface, unspoken or ignored.

Now, the supporting energies—this presence and that influence—are tugging at the story here. This current screams order and control but paired with your reversed Queen of Cups, it’s like there’s a battle between needing structure and feeling emotionally chaotic. Maybe you’re trying to hold everything together on the outside, but inside? That influence hints at recovery, a slow, reluctant healing after some kind of emotional blowout or betrayal. You’re not over it yet, but you’re not letting it crush you either. That’s something. It’s a messy, uneven process.

And the current from earlier cards—the Queen of Wands reversed, Five of Pentacles, King of Pentacles reversed, plus the Hermit—are all feeding into this emotional gridlock. You might feel isolated, like you’re carrying burdens that no one else sees, which is brutal. The King of Pentacles reversed warns about instability in your financial or material world, and that insecurity leaks into the emotional realm, making it even harder to feel grounded. The Hermit is there's too, nudging you toward solitude for reflection—but solitude can feel less like a break and more like being stuck in a room with your own tangled thoughts.

Honestly, you might be caught between wanting to take care of yourself and the pressure to be “the strong one” in your circle. That’s exhausting, right? Like you’re expected to hold the castle walls while your own foundation feels shaky. And you’re not always sure who to trust with the real you when the Queen of Cups is flipped like this—vulnerable but guarded, emotional but closed off.

It’s a weird space to be in. You’re craving emotional nourishment but maybe can’t find it where you thought it would be. Or you’re second-guessing your own feelings, wondering if you’re just overreacting or missing something. That’s the cruelest part—doubting yourself when you should be your own biggest ally.

If you’re feeling this, don’t beat yourself up. It’s okay to admit you’re not okay. The healing is uneven, and it’s going to take some honest, maybe uncomfortable work. You’re not broken, but you’re definitely in the middle of a reset. And that’s a bumpy place to be, but also a necessary one.

Anyway.

Okay so here’s where this gets real: you’ve been running on fumes with that energy where confidence is just a flicker, not a flame. You felt this already—something’s off, the fire’s low, and maybe the spotlight feels a little too bright when all you want is to duck out and breathe. But it’s not just about feeling burned out; it’s about the cold spots, the places where support should be and isn’t. That pinch of isolation? Yeah, that’s been showing up in your bank account, your friendships, maybe even the way your living space feels less “home” and more “temporary stop.”

And then there’s this king figure who’s supposed to bring stability but keeps slipping—like the foundation is shaky or the rules keep changing. That’s a classic power struggle scenario: someone holding the purse strings but not quite owning their part of the deal, leaving you to wonder where the grown-ups are supposed to be. The current of control and order is there, but it’s more like running on a treadmill, full speed, no real progress. You caught this, because you felt that tension simmering beneath the surface every time you tried to make a plan or set a boundary.

Meanwhile, the invitation to go inward has been loud and clear. That pull to pull back, to sit with yourself, maybe even question what you really want without the noise. It’s so tempting to dive into the distractions, to fill the silence with anything, but the quiet is necessary—even if it feels lonely or like you’re missing out. You’re not just hiding; you’re recalibrating. And the upside? That space lets you see the emotional undercurrents you’ve been ignoring. The parts that don’t show up in texts, meetings, or paycheck stubs. 

But here’s the kicker: feelings have been messy. The emotional container’s cracked wide open, spilling confusion, maybe even some tears you didn’t expect. It’s like trying to hold water in your hands. You might have tried to keep the peace by bottling it up, but that’s not sustainable. The current here screams, “Face it.” Not as punishment, but as an invitation to real healing, something deeper than surface-level fixes. You already clocked this—you already knew this was coming once the mask slipped.

And yeah, that supporting energies energy about authority and endings flips the script a bit. It’s like the universe is saying, “You’ve been betrayed by your own expectations or the structures you trusted.” But also, “There’s a chance here to redefine what power means for you.” It’s messy, but it’s not all doom. Sometimes the most painful cuts are the ones that let new growth happen—if you’re ready to stop carrying the weight that isn’t yours.

So what’s next? Maybe start by setting one small boundary. Say no to that one thing that’s draining you, or call out the imbalance where you see it. You don’t have to overhaul everything overnight, but this is about taking back the wheel, even if it’s just inch by inch. You’ve been waiting for permission or the perfect time, but that’s a mirage. The time is now to reclaim your fire, even if it’s a flicker at first.

You feeling this? Like it’s time to stop ghosting your own needs and start showing up for yourself in a way that sticks. If anything here landed or shook something loose, you already know what to do.
