Hey Cancer! November’s creeping in, and I’m catching this vibe like you’re stepping out of a fog. You know that weird spot where things felt off but you couldn’t put your finger on why? Yeah, this is that moment—when you realize maybe you weren’t seeing the full picture, or maybe you were seeing the wrong one entirely.

The Moon, reversed. Oh wow. This card is shouting confusion cleared up, but not without a fight. You knew something was off, right? That feeling that maybe someone wasn’t being straight with you, or worse, you weren’t being straight with yourself. There's peeling back those shadows, and it’s raw. This influence hanging around underneath, shows someone who’s emotionally all over the place — maybe you, maybe them. It’s like trying to hold water in your hands; feelings spilled, promises broken, or maybe just emotional control slipping through the cracks. You saw it coming, even if you didn’t want to admit it. Don’t lie to yourself — you knew before you said it. 

Then there’s this presence adding this whole layer of questioning what you thought was solid. Traditions? Rules? Moral codes? Flipped upside down here. Maybe it’s about a relationship, a family expectation, or even your own idea of what “should” happen. This card’s telling me that the usual playbook is off the table. You’re not following the script anymore, and that’s scary but necessary. You’re done playing by someone else’s rules that don’t fit you. That’s the real kicker under this whole Moon current reversed. 

But let me say this: The Moon reversed isn’t just about catching lies or illusions. It’s about waking up from pretending. You might be realizing something uncomfortable — like the person you trusted is not who you thought, or maybe you’ve been hiding from your own truth. What’s feeding into this presence makes it tricky to know what to trust. You’re not blind anymore, but the clarity feels harsh, maybe even brutal. That influence nearby says someone’s emotions are in chaos — they might be gaslighting, overreacting, or just plain cold. That’s the kind of emotional mess you’re dealing with, and it’s exhausting.

And this influence? That’s like the universe slapping the handbook out of your hands and saying, “Nope, not this time.” It’s breaking you free from old values or expectations that kept you stuck, but it does that by shaking your foundation. So yeah, it’s unsettling. You’re questioning everything you thought was stable. 

Wait, I’m seeing something else. This isn’t just about confusion ending. It’s about you stepping into a new reality without the safety net of old beliefs or emotional lies. You might be feeling unmoored, but you’re actually on the edge of something real, something you chose because you can’t live the lie anymore. That’s tough. You’re probably second-guessing yourself, wondering if you jumped too soon or if you’re missing something. But honestly, you caught this. You saw the cracks before the whole thing fell apart.

Okay. So. Hmm. Wait. Yeah.

Three of Swords, reversed. Oh wow.

You thought the worst was done. The heartbreak, the cut to the bone—you started to patch it up, right? But no, this isn’t a clean fix. This presence says you’re still picking at the scab, still reopening the wound when you swore you were done. The reversed Three of Swords shows that you might be avoiding the full truth. You’re trying to unbreak something that needs more than just “pretend it’s fine” current. Maybe you’re replaying old fights in your head, scrolling through texts you shouldn’t be reading, or still checking their social media, hoping for a different story. You knew before you said it—this isn’t moving on.

What’s feeding into this? This influence lurking beneath this presence says the emotional control isn’t there. You’re feeling off-balance, maybe even cold or distant, but inside it’s a mess. This isn’t the mature emotional support you need—it’s more like the opposite. You might be bottling things up or, worse, pushing people away. You’re not the calm, steady presence here; you’re the storm brewing underneath. That’s why the Three of Swords reversed feels like a trap. You want to heal, but you keep running into the same emotional dead end. That vibe warns: don’t confuse emotional numbness for peace.

And then there’s this presence holding down this current’s ground. Traditional fixes? They won’t cut it. No charity hugs or “just forgive and forget” speeches will get you out. This card says rules and old scripts are off the table. You can’t lean on the usual advice, the cookie-cutter relationship templates, or the “what’s expected.” You’re rewriting the playbook, whether you like it or not. You might be questioning everything you believed about love, loyalty, and what you deserve. It's pushing you to break free from the “shoulds” and “musts.” It’s uncomfortable, but it’s necessary.

So, what’s actually going on? You’re stuck in this limbo where you want to heal but keep sabotaging yourself. It’s like you’re waiting for someone to say sorry, or waiting for a sign that it’s okay to let go, but the silence is deafening. You’re avoiding your own feelings because facing them means admitting you got played or that you didn’t see the red flags. You sensed this—you already knew this was coming. The Moon reversed showed the illusions fading, and now this card confirms the aftermath. You’re untangling from confusion, but it’s messy and slow.

Here’s the kicker: the current here is not about rushing to “be over it.” It’s about doing the real work—calling out your own role in the pain, standing firm on your boundaries, and refusing to get pulled back into the same drama. That influence says you have to regain your emotional footing first. That might mean saying no to someone who’s still toxic, or cutting cords with people who aren’t showing up. This vibe isn’t just about rebellion—it’s about finding your own truth without the usual safety nets.

You don’t have to have all the answers right now. What matters is that you stop pretending you’re fine when you’re not. Stop scrolling through old texts or rehashing every argument in your head. It’s time to put your energy where it counts: self-respect, clear boundaries, and honest conversations with yourself. You’re done with the emotional rollercoaster that’s been draining you.

Wait, I’m seeing something else. This is shifting now. Yeah.

Queen of Cups, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so this card is hitting where it hurts. You’re trying to stay connected, but something’s off. Not just a little off, like spilled coffee on your shirt off, but the kind of off where you’re second-guessing your own feelings. You thought you were the one holding the emotional fort, except right now it feels like you’re running on empty. You’re not ignoring your gut—you’re just confused by it.

The vibe here is like you’re trying to care, but the usual well of empathy is dry or muddy. Instead of feeling balanced and steady, you’re probably swinging between too much sensitivity and shutting down entirely. This isn’t the Queen of Cups in her natural state—the one who’s calm, compassionate, and totally in tune with herself and others. Nope. It’s a disruption. You might be overreacting or numbing out, or maybe both depending on the day and who’s around.

I’m seeing this card connect with the reversed card lurking underneath. That’s the adult version of emotional control gone sideways—either bottled up feelings or mood swings that catch you off guard. You’re not just struggling with your own emotions; somebody else in your circle might be flipping their script too. It’s a tricky mix because neither of you are showing up clear or steady, which messes with trust and any chance at real conversation.

This Queen reversed also ties back to the previous cards, especially the Moon flipped and the Three of Swords reversed. The Moon, reversed, is about seeing through illusions, but with the Queen reversed, it’s not so much clarity as it is emotional confusion. You’re trying to decode what’s real and what’s projection, but your feelings are tangled, and your head is probably not helping. Then the Three of Swords reversed suggests some kind of healing or moving on from heartbreak, but it’s half-baked at best; you’re not fully past it, which means the emotional fog is still thick.

You felt this already—you knew this wasn’t just a rough patch. This to emotional boundaries being crossed or ignored, whether by you or someone else. Maybe you’ve been giving too much, or you’re holding back because you’re scared of getting hurt again. Either way, it’s messing with your ability to be present and honest. This influence in the background suggests the usual rules or traditions about relationships and feelings aren’t working for you right now. Maybe you’re resisting what’s expected or rejecting old patterns that no longer serve.

Here’s the thing: this isn’t forever. It’s a phase where your emotional compass is off, but you still have the capacity to recalibrate. You can’t force clarity, but you can start by noticing where your energy is leaking—maybe it’s in conversations that go nowhere, or in trying to fix someone else’s feelings at the cost of your own. The next 24 hours? Watch your reactions, especially when you feel triggered or shut down. That’s your cue to pause, breathe, and maybe step back before things spiral.

You might want to text someone, not to hash out all the emotions, but just to check in. Keep it light, keep it simple. Sometimes just breaking the silence is enough to shift the mood. And if you feel like you’re too far gone for that, that’s okay too. Give yourself the space to feel weird without pressure to “fix” it immediately.

The jaw tight, stomach drop moments? Those are your body telling you something’s off. Don’t brush them aside. Instead, use those signals to catch yourself before you get sucked into emotional chaos.

Okay, so there's rough, but you’re not stuck in it. You’re just caught in the middle of feelings that don’t line up neatly. You get it.

The Empress. Oh wow. This one’s bringing some heavy energy, no kidding. You’ve been in this loop—shadows of confusion with The Moon, reversed, trying to hide what your gut already screamed. That Three of Swords, reversed, showed you trying to stitch up a broken heart, but the tape’s barely holding. And the Queen of Cups, reversed? Yeah, that’s you shutting off the faucet on your own feelings, maybe pretending you’re fine while everything inside feels off.

Now, The Empress steps in, and she’s raw power—except you’re not just getting a gentle nudge toward comfort. This card is saying, “No more starving yourself emotionally or creatively.” You’ve been neglecting what feeds your soul. The Empress is all about growth, abundance, and nurturing. But here’s the catch: it’s not coming from someone else. No new seeds planted by a partner or friend who’s been MIA or gaslighting you, like this presence lurking underneath. Nope. It’s on you.

You already clocked this out loud. You’ve been clinging to old hurts, trying to patch over pain instead of letting it burn out. This card’s pulling you off that hamster wheel. The Empress wants you to claim your space, your worth, your creativity. And not in some vague, “I’ll start tomorrow” way. It’s happening now. Her energy is pushing you to build a life that reflects what you want, not what you’ve been told you deserve.

That Hierophant, reversed, lurking under the surface? It’s telling you to question the rules you’ve been following—maybe traditions or expectations that never fit you. You might have been stuck obeying a script that’s suffocating your growth. The Empress is the exact opposite. She’s about breaking free from that and creating your own version of abundance and love.

Look, the Queen of Cups, reversed, shows you’ve been emotionally exhausted, maybe even numb. You closed yourself off because the heartbreak was too much, and people around you weren’t showing up emotionally either. But The Empress is reminding you: if you don’t nurture yourself, no one else will. This isn’t about waiting for a rescue—it’s about planting your own garden and getting your hands dirty. It’s a call to start investing in your own well-being, your creative projects, your physical health, your surroundings.

That Three of Swords, reversed, isn’t about denial—it’s about healing in your own time. The Empress says don’t rush, but don’t stall either. You can’t grow flowers in winter. You need to create space for warmth, for kindness, for what makes you thrive. So, if you’ve been stuck in this cycle of hiding feelings or hoping someone else will fix what’s broken, this card is your reality check.

You’re being asked to own your power and stop waiting for permission. The Empress says, “Your body, your mind, your emotions—they all deserve care.” If you’ve been scolding yourself for feeling off or for not bouncing back fast enough, stop. This is about slow, steady growth. And yes, it’s messy. Growth always is.

You might have been giving your energy away, hoping for love or approval that never came. Now it’s your turn to fill that well. This influence under this, is a warning: don’t fall for the same emotional dead ends again. Trust what you feel, even if it scares you. The Empress is your permission slip to build a life that nourishes you, no matter what anyone else says.

So what’s the next move? Start small. Think about what makes you feel safe, seen, and supported by you. Maybe that’s setting boundaries, saying no to people who drain you, or finally starting that side hustle you shelved. Whatever it is—start. The Empress isn’t patient with waiting games.

You get it. This is your moment to reclaim your emotional and creative power. It’s not about perfection. It’s about showing up for yourself, even if you’re scared or tired. So, what are you waiting for?

Mm.

Seven of Pentacles. Huh??

Okay, listen—this card’s not about instant gratification. It’s hanging out in your energy like that long sigh after a marathon meeting, the kind where you’re staring at a spreadsheet thinking, “Did all this effort really move the needle?” You knew it deep down. That itch of impatience, the quiet grumbling under your breath about “when is this going to pay off?” — it’s loud in here. But the Seven of Pentacles is the universe’s way of saying, “Hold up, slow down, the harvest isn’t ready yet.” 

Look, I’m not gonna sugarcoat it. You’re probably tired of investing time, emotions, maybe even money into something that feels stuck. Whether it’s a relationship that’s been on life support, a side hustle that’s more drain than gain, or just your own headspace swirling in confusion and doubt. You’ve been watering this garden, but the fruits? Not quite ripe. And that’s frustrating because you want action — results, movement, proof that it’s worth it. But you’re still in the growth phase, and that’s a grind, no matter how you slice it.

What’s wild here is the tension with the other cards lurking around. With The Moon reversed and the Three of Swords reversed, there’s a hint that you’re trying to shake off old wounds and illusions, but something’s still murky. The Queen of Cups reversed alongside that influence is throwing emotional chaos into the mix—like you’re trying to manage your feelings but the emotional system’s just glitching out. So yeah, your patience is being tested at a time when your heart feels like it’s got its own weather system. 

The Empress is there's too, though, like a reminder that growth is happening beneath the surface. It’s quiet, maybe invisible to the naked eye, but real. You’re nurturing something—yourself, your projects, your connections—and even if it doesn’t feel like it, you’re building a foundation. This influence adds a twist: maybe what you’re growing isn’t in line with the usual rules, or traditional paths feel like a dead end. You might be questioning the old way of doing things or rejecting the mold altogether. That’s brave, but it also means there’s no shortcut here, no fast track.

So what do you do, when the seeds you planted don’t sprout overnight? You keep at it, yeah, but you also need to check in. Are you working toward what you really want, or just what you think you should want? Are you nurturing your vision or just stuck in the habit of waiting? The Seven of Pentacles is about honest appraisal, about not lying to yourself just because you want to feel better. Look at the progress, small as it may be. It’s okay to feel restless, to want more, but don’t sabotage what’s growing by giving up too soon.

You feeling this? It’s a tough spot, no doubt. But it’s also a chance to realign, to decide if the soil you’re tilling is the right soil for you, or if it’s time to plant somewhere new. Either way, the power is yours. You’re in the middle of a slow burn—sometimes that’s all the universe’s energy can offer. And honestly, it’s enough.

Anyway.

Okay, so here’s where this gets real. You caught those moments when things just didn’t line up emotionally, right? Like You sensed this—there was something off, something unspoken twisting under the surface that you tried to smooth out. But that energy, that feeling of disconnect, it’s not just in your head. And trust me, it’s not about ignoring it either. It’s about seeing it for what it is—an invitation to stop pretending you’re okay when you’re not.

You might’ve caught yourself holding back, maybe even guarding your feelings like they’re fragile glass. But the Queen of Cups flipped sideways? That’s the warning that your emotional well has been running low, or worse, getting polluted by someone else’s stormy waves. And if this influence nearby is reversed too? Yeah, that’s a double whammy of emotional immaturity or inconsistency around you. So how do you play that? You don’t. You set boundaries that make your heart feel safe again. No more emotional potholes.

And look, the Empress is sitting it's like the boss of growth and abundance, but it’s not just about planting seeds outdoors or some vague “manifestation.” It’s about nurturing yourself with the same fierce love you give to others or want to get. That means facing the stalled efforts—the things you’ve been putting your energy into that have yet to bloom. The Seven of Pentacles isn’t about impatience; it’s about honest check-ins. Are you waiting for a miracle, or are you ready to make a call, sign a paper, or say no to what’s draining you? Sometimes the most radical act is choosing yourself instead of hoping someone else will.

And that reversed Hierophant? That’s your cue to question tradition, the rules, the “shoulds” that don’t fit anymore. Maybe it’s about your living situation, your relationship setup, or even how you handle your money. Whatever felt safe is showing cracks, and you’re being asked to rewrite the manual. You felt this already—you already knew this. The universe isn’t handing you the same old script twice.

Here’s the kicker: there’s healing under all this mess, but it’s not linear. The Three of Swords reversed whispers that painful heartbreak or betrayal is loosening its grip, but it’s still there, lurking. You’re not over it yet, and that’s okay. Healing asks for time, for patience, and sometimes for tough love. If someone’s been gaslighting your feelings or you’ve been gaslighting yourself, the fog lifts only when you pull the blinds open.

Wait, I’m seeing a next step here—reach out, but not to numb the pain. Reach out to your own clarity. Write down what you want, what you won’t settle for, and then don’t be afraid to act on it. Whether that means calling out someone’s behavior or signing a lease on a new space that feels like a fresh start, movement is the medicine here.

You feeling this? The one thing you could do with right now is stop pretending the old ways work and start living the life that actually fits you. No more reruns, no more waiting on someone else’s permission.
