Hey Pisces! November’s started with that weird mix of “What now?” and “Okay, maybe this will work.” You’ve been juggling some wins and wondering if they’re real or just smoke and mirrors. The current today feels like it’s pushing you toward a spotlight moment, but hold on, let’s see what’s really going on.

Six of Wands. Oh wow. This card is yelling “Victory,” but it’s not just any win—it’s the kind you get when you’ve been putting in work behind the scenes and people finally notice. You knew this already, right? That moment when your effort stops being invisible. It’s not about luck; it’s about showing up and actually doing the thing you said you would do. Maybe you nailed a presentation. Maybe you got that promotion or finally hit a personal goal. Whatever it is, you’re in that zone where people are clapping, and yeah, it feels good.

But here’s the catch. This presence isn’t just about applause. It’s also about control—owning what’s yours without needing to shout it from the rooftops. The supporting vibe underneath this is like having all the tools lined up and making sure none of them get stolen or misused. You’re on alert for anyone trying to sneak around your success or take credit. It’s the difference between celebrating and guarding your ground. 

You might be dealing with someone who’s been less than honest lately. Maybe they’ve been sneaky, trying to take shortcuts or cut corners, but you’re catching it. The reversed card beneath this victory says you’re done letting people get away with that. You’re watching now. If someone’s been playing games, you’re exposing it. No more blind trust or giving the benefit of the doubt when the signs are flashing red.

This card is also about confidence—like you’re walking into a room and owning it, not because you need validation but because you know what you bring. That kind of energy is magnetic, and it’s making others take notice, whether you want them to or not. You might be realizing that stepping into your power means saying no to distractions or drama that don’t serve you anymore. You’re done with that noise.

I’m seeing this moment as one where you’re claiming your space. You’re no longer waiting for permission or approval. You’re making moves on your terms, and people see that. This influence beneath this is fueling your ability to manifest, but it’s not magic—it’s skill, work, and focus. You’re not just hoping for things to happen. You’re making them happen. And you’re keeping an eye out for anyone trying to undermine that.

There’s a strong message here: don’t let sneaky behavior slide. If you spot someone bending the truth or trying to get ahead unfairly, call it out. You have the power to shift the balance back to fairness, and you’re ready for that. This isn’t about being paranoid; it’s about protecting your wins and making sure your energy isn’t wasted on people who don’t respect it.

You’re at a turning point where you’re stepping fully into your success and refusing to let anyone dim it. But this also means being clear-eyed about who’s for real and who’s just pretending. That clarity is part of your power right now.

Okay. So. Hmm. Wait. Yeah.

The Tower, reversed. Oh wow.

Alright, so you’re holding onto something that’s already cracked—maybe a relationship, a project, or an idea—that’s ready to fall apart but you’re not letting it go. You knew this was coming, right? The Six of Wands showed you that win, that spotlight moment, but now the foundation’s shaky. This card’s screaming: “Don’t lie to yourself—you already knew this was a house of cards.” The Tower reversed pulls back the full collapse, but it’s more like a slow leak, a drip that shapes the whole picture underneath.

Here’s what’s feeding into this: this presence’s current is right there, but twisted by that influence. So, yeah, you have all the tools. You’ve got the skills, the charm, the power to make things happen. But this influence? It says you’re trying to fix this with honesty after a sneaky move or some kind of deception got tangled in the mix. Maybe you or someone else tried to cover something up, and now you’re trying to clean it up with truth bombs. It’s messy. You’re trying to rebuild trust, but the cracks are deep.

You might have stepped back from a full-blown crisis, but the current is still unstable. You’re holding your breath, hoping the whole thing doesn’t come down. That’s exhausting. You’re patching holes, but the pressure’s building. This isn’t about a sudden, violent crash. It’s more like watching a slow-motion collapse and hoping the pieces don’t hit the floor. There’s a lot of tension here, with you juggling the desire to fix things and the reality that some damage can’t be undone by just willing it so. This current says you can manifest, but not if the foundation’s rotten.

Six of Wands had you riding high, feeling like you’d won something big. But now, under this surface, The Tower reversed is whispering that the win might be hollow. Maybe the applause was premature, or maybe you celebrated before the real work started. Either way, you’re in a spot where you can’t fully celebrate because you know what’s lurking. The current underneath is about facing the truth you ran from. You might be coming clean or trying to, but it’s a slow process. You’re not fooling anyone, least of all yourself.

If you’ve been trying to keep this together by spinning stories or bending facts, that’s what that influence is calling out. You’re trying to be honest now, but it’s late, and the damage is still there. This card says: clean up your act, or the slow collapse continues. This presence’s power is in your hands, but it won’t work without full honesty. You can’t build magic on shaky ground.

Watch what you do this week. If you keep patching with quick fixes, this presence drags on. But if you face the truth—no matter how ugly or uncomfortable—you start to shift the whole thing. It’s not instant. It’s messy. But it’s real. You get it.

Yeah.

Queen of Swords, reversed. Huh??

Okay, so this card just showed up sideways on you, and it’s not messing around. This isn’t your typical sharp, clear-headed queen slicing through nonsense. Nope, this one’s off her game, tangled in fog and maybe a little extra stubborn where you least expect it. You knew before you said it—this queen isn’t making decisions like usual. She’s hesitating. Maybe she’s holding onto old grudges or refusing to see the whole picture. That jaw tight? Yeah, that’s real. It’s like you’re trying to pull the story together, but the pieces keep slipping out of your hands.

Look, Six of Wands had you feeling like you were on the rise, right? Like you finally had that win, that moment to show up and claim some credit. But then The Tower, reversed, popped in with its silent warning—not the full-blown disaster, but definitely something cracked underneath the surface. A near-collapse that you dodged but couldn’t ignore. That tension from those two cards is hanging heavy here. The Queen of Swords, reversed, is the stubborn aftershock. The part of you that’s still replaying what almost fell apart, still sharpening old doubts and half-truths. 

And here’s the kicker—those supporting energies are whispering underneath this, pushing this queen’s story. There in the mix, which means you’ve got the tools, the skills, the resources to flip the situation. But instead of using those, this reversed queen is stuck in defense mode, like she’s guarding a secret or holding back because she’s not sure if she can trust herself yet. Then there’s this presence showing you’re ready to drop the sneaky stuff or stop playing games. You want the truth, even if it’s messy. That’s the current feeding this hesitation; a real push to come clean or at least clear the air. But the queen? She’s dragging her feet.

You’re probably caught between wanting to cut through the confusion and feeling like you’re wearing someone else’s glasses—everything looks blurry, the edges don’t line up. Maybe you’re second-guessing a conversation you had or a boundary you tried to set. Or maybe you’re stuck replaying someone else’s story in your head, and it’s poisoning your clarity. You sensed this—you already knew this. The Queen of Swords reversed doesn’t lie; she just refuses to face the truth head-on sometimes.

In practical terms, this feels like a communication breakdown. Maybe you sent a message, waited for a reply, and it never came. Or you’re trying to sort out a situation at work or home where everyone’s talking past each other, and you’re the one stuck in the middle with your stomach dropping. You’re not crazy for feeling frustrated. That energy is real. The problem? You might be holding onto old versions of the story or refusing to pivot because it feels safer than admitting you missed something. 

This isn’t forever; it’s a phase where your mind is sorting through what’s real and what’s just noise. But you’ve got to make a move here. If you stay stuck in that reversed queen energy, you’ll waste time and current on what-ifs and “if onlys.” this undertone’s telling you you’ve got everything you need to reset the narrative. This influence means dropping the act, cutting the games, or finally owning your part in the mess.

What’s the next step? Text the person you’ve been avoiding. Ask the hard question you’ve been dodging. Speak up, even if your voice shakes. Don’t wait for the perfect moment—that’s just the queen’s hesitation talking. You’re stronger than that. Trust that your edge is still there; it’s just a little dull right now. Sharpen it by action, not overthinking.

Yeah.

Ace of Swords. Oh wow.  

Alright, guys, this one’s cutting right to the chase. You’re holding a sharp new truth here — no fluff, no detours. After the Six of Wands had you riding high on some kind of win, and then The Tower, reversed, tried to sneak in with that slow-motion disaster vibe, here’s the Ace of Swords bringing clarity like a spotlight switching on. But this isn’t just any clarity — it’s the kind that slices through old stories, especially after the Queen of Swords, reversed, brewed some confusion or harsh self-talk.  

You felt this already, right? That moment when your mind finally clicks, and everything you were dodging gets called out loud. Maybe it’s about someone in your life who’s been playing chess while you were stuck with checkers—or maybe it’s you, finally done with the foggy thinking, deciding to cut ties with whatever was holding you back. This influence lurking underneath this says you’ve got all the tools. Like, the whole kit. But here’s the catch: that vibe whispers you’re done hiding. No more sneaky moves or mental gymnastics. You’re stepping into raw honesty, no masks, no running.  

I’m seeing this Ace of Swords as a wake-up call that’s also a weapons upgrade. You’re armed, but the real fight is with yourself—your own doubts, your own stories that kept you stuck. The Queen of Swords reversed showed that foggy, indecisive energy, the kind that keeps you replaying the same arguments in your head or twisting words to avoid facing what’s true. Now? You’re done with that. This card is sharp, decisive. It’s saying: speak up, set the record straight, or walk away with your head held high.  

If you’ve been waiting for the universe to hand you a sign, this is it. But signs don’t always come wrapped in pretty bows. Sometimes the truth stings, and you’re the one who has to deliver it to yourself first before anyone else. That Six of Wands was sweet — victory, applause, all the good stuff — but you know that win was built on shaky ground, which The Tower reversed tried to warn you about. It’s like you dodged the collapse, but the cracks are still there, and the Ace of Swords is here to make you notice them.  

Here’s the real kicker: this card isn’t about indecision anymore. It’s about cutting through the noise and making a clear choice. The Queen of Swords reversed was all about hesitation or maybe even avoiding confrontation because it felt safer. Yeah, safer, but also stuck. This Ace? It’s saying no more hiding behind that. You’re ready to speak your mind, even if it’s uncomfortable. Especially if it’s uncomfortable.  

And listen, this presence doesn’t guarantee it’s going to be easy. This influence is powerful, but that vibe is like a call-out for integrity. If you’ve been bending the truth or playing games, you’re done. Now you have to show up honest, or else this Ace just becomes a sword turned on your own back. It’s a hard truth, but an important one.  

So what do you do with all this? Test it in daylight. Say what needs saying out loud. You already clocked this — you already knew what had to be said. If they wanted to, they would have shown up differently, but that’s not your job to fix anymore. Your job is to own your truth and let the chips fall where they may.  

Okay.

Nine of Pentacles, reversed. Huh??

Okay, let’s start here: you already knew something was off. You knew it deep down — that sense of independence and financial comfort you thought you had? It’s shaky. The reversed Nine of Pentacles is that moment when you realize the security blanket isn’t as warm as you hoped. Maybe bills are piling up, or you’re suddenly questioning if what you built really belongs to you. It’s the kind of card that whispers, “Hold on, not everything is yours to claim yet.” It’s not necessarily disaster, but it’s a warning light blinking “reassess.” 

I’m feeling a vibe of overextension, something about trying to keep up appearances—like you’re still playing the role of someone who has it all figured out, but inside, the foundation’s cracking. That supporting energies, this presence combined with This influence is key here. It’s like you’ve got all the tools but maybe you used them the wrong way or held onto some illusion. This current asks, “Are you really using your power wisely, or just spinning stories to cover gaps?” And this influence? It’s about coming clean, facing the truth, owning what’s real rather than sneaking around with half-baked plans or denial.

Don’t get me wrong, that reversed Queen of Swords earlier shows this isn’t about sharp clarity or cutting through the noise — it’s more like muddied waters. You might be stuck in your head, second-guessing everything, or worse, avoiding the hard truths because the idea of losing control feels unbearable. But the Ace of Swords is there's too, so the universe’s saying, “Look, the moment for breakthrough is here. Time to slice through the fog.” 

But back to this Nine of Pentacles reversed—she’s the one who usually stands in her garden, calm and collected, symbolizing self-sufficiency and earned luxury. Reversed? It’s like the garden’s overgrown or neglected, the fruits not quite ripe, or maybe picked before their time. You could be feeling less like the boss of your life and more like a guest, watching someone else’s success from the sidelines. It’s a tough spot because you want to claim your space, but something’s holding you back. Maybe it’s fear, maybe it’s a recent hit to your confidence, or a financial situation you thought was stable that isn’t.

Oh, and with The Tower reversed earlier? That’s all about resisting change, refusing to let go of structures that no longer serve you. You might be stuck in that half-collapsed building, pretending it’s still safe when it’s not. The current is hesitant, cautious, like you’re waiting for a sign to make the leap but scared the ground will give way beneath you.

Here’s the kicker: the spotlight is on authenticity, not perfection. The reversed Nine of Pentacles is a call to stop pretending or keeping up a facade. If you’re feeling less than secure, that’s okay. Own it. You don’t have to have it all together today. This presence suggest that real power comes from honesty and recalibrating your strategy, not from illusion or shortcuts.

This could be about money, sure, but it’s also about self-worth and how you value your own efforts. You might be trying to fit into a mold that no longer fits, or hoping that external validation will shore up what feels unstable inside. Spoiler: it won’t.

What’s coming through loud and clear is the need to drop the act, face what’s real, and rebuild from a place of truth—even if it feels messy right now. You’re not alone in feeling like the rug’s pulled from under you. The difference is if you lean into this, you can find a stronger footing than before.

Anyway.

Okay, so here’s the thing—you probably felt that jolt coming a mile away, like a glitch in the matrix or someone hitting the eject button before the whole scene collapses. You caught it, or else you wouldn’t be here, right? That moment when you realize the story you’ve been telling yourself about control or clarity is actually just a shaky facade. It’s not about the mess breaking you; it’s about what you’re going to do with the pieces once they’re on the floor. And you know what? The current around you is pointing at a truth that’s been hiding under the rug: you’ve been trying to wield power with blurry lenses.

That reversal you’re carrying? It’s not just a sideways glance at logic; it’s a full-on refusal to see things the way they really are. Maybe you’ve been cutting corners, or maybe you’ve been avoiding the hard questions about loyalty or honesty—either way, the deck’s calling it out. The supporting energies didn’t pull any punches either. There’s a subtle but undeniable invitation to drop the sneaky tactics and step into a space where what you manifest aligns with what you actually deliver. No smoke and mirrors, no pretending to have all the answers when the truth feels too sharp.

And that sharpness—the one that’s supposed to slice through confusion—is definitely there, but it’s not always playing fair. Sometimes, it’s a blunt instrument wielded without precision, cutting through the air but missing the target. That’s the current of the queen you’re channeling, but reversed. She’s got the intellect, sure, but the judgment is clouded, and the boundaries? More like suggestions than hard lines. That’s a tricky terrain for your mind and heart because it’s like trying to build a fortress out of fog. You’re craving clarity, but you’re also scared of what it might reveal if you actually get it.

Now, here’s the kicker: the opportunity for a fresh start is right there, bright and unassuming. It’s the kind of energy that promises a clean slate if you’re willing to cut through the noise and claim it. But—big but—you can’t just snap your fingers and call it done. That new beginning demands a sharper focus than you’ve been giving yourself lately. It wants you to be honest, clear, and strategic. Like the universe is handing you a sword, but you have to learn how to hold it steady without flinching.

And let’s talk about the money and independence side of things—there’s some hesitancy around stepping fully into your power there. The vibe is definitely not the one where you’re enjoying the fruits of your labor without a second thought. It’s more like you’re caught between wanting that security and fearing you have to sacrifice your freedom or your authenticity to get it. That disconnect? It’s real, and it’s loud. You’re not quite in the place where you trust yourself to handle the perks without losing something else in the process. You’re guarding yourself, but maybe too tightly.

So what’s the move? Honestly, it might be time to call out the smoke for what it is—no more pretending the distractions or the half-truths are working in your favor. If there’s someone or something you need to call out, do it. If you need to block off energy that’s been draining you under the guise of “support,” now’s the moment. You’ve got the tools and the chance to reset, but only if you stop wobbling on the edge and actually step forward. No more sidestepping the hard calls.

You feeling this? You sensed this, didn’t you? Like, that moment when you realize the game’s changed, even if you’re not sure if you’re ready to play by the new rules. You’ve got some work to do, sure—but you’re far from powerless here.
